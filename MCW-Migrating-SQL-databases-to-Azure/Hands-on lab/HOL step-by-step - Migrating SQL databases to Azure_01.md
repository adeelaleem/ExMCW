## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement a proof-of-concept (PoC) for migrating an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database into Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI). You perform assessments to reveal any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database and Azure's managed database offerings. You then migrate the customer's on-premises gamer information web application and database into Azure, with minimal down-time. Finally, you enable some of the advanced SQL features in SQL MI to improve security and performance in the customer's application.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement a cloud migration solution for business-critical applications and databases.
