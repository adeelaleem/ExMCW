# Migrating SQL databases to Azure before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work.

> **Important**: You must have sufficient rights within your Azure AD tenant to create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal and assign roles on your subscription to complete this hands-on lab.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all steps provided _before_ attending the Hands-on lab.

> **Important**: Many Azure resources require globally unique names. Throughout these steps, the word "SUFFIX" appears as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or other value to ensure uniquely named resources.

### Task 1: Create a resource group

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. On the Resource groups blade, select **+Add**.

   ![+Add is highlighted in the toolbar on Resource groups blade.](media/resource-groups-add.png "Resource groups")

3. On the Create a resource group **Basics** tab, enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource group**: Enter `hands-on-lab-SUFFIX` as the name of the new resource group.
   - **Region**: Select the region you are using for this hands-on lab.

   ![The values specified above are entered into the Create a resource group Basics tab.](media/create-resource-group.png "Create resource group")

4. Select **Review + Create**.

5. On the **Review + create** tab, ensure the Validation passed message is displayed and then select **Create**.

### Task 2: Register the Microsoft DataMigration resource provider

In this task, you register the `Microsoft.DataMigration` resource provider with your Azure subscription. Registration of this resource provider is necessary to create an Azure Database Migration Service within your subscription.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Subscriptions** from the Azure services list.

   ![Subscriptions is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-subscriptions.png "Azure services")

2. Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab from the list.

   ![The target subscription is highlighted in the subscriptions list.](media/azure-subscriptions.png "Subscriptions list")

3. On the Subscription blade, select **Resource providers** from the left-hand menu and then enter "migration" into the filter box.

   ![Resource providers is highlighted in the left-hand menu of the Subscription blade. On the Resource providers blade, migration is entered into the filter box.](media/azure-portal-subscriptions-resource-providers-register-microsoft-datamigration.png "Resource provider registration")

4. If the `Microsoft.DataMigration` provider's status is `NotRegistered`, select **Register** in the toolbar.

   ![The Register button is highlighted in the Resource Providers toolbar.](media/azure-subscriptions-resource-providers-toolbar.png "Resource providers toolbar")

5. It can take a couple of minutes for the registration to complete. Make sure you see the status set to **Registered** before moving on. You may need to select **Refresh** on the toolbar to see the updated status.

   ![Registered is highlighted next to the Microsoft.DataMigration resource provider.](media/resource-providers-datamigration-registered.png "Microsoft DataMigration Resource Provider")

### Task 3: Run ARM template to provision lab resources

In this task, you run an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to create the resources required for this hands-on lab. The components are deployed inside a new virtual network (VNet) to facilitate communication between the VMs and SQL MI. The ARM template also adds inbound and outbound security rules to the network security groups associated with SQL MI and the VMs, including opening port 3389 to allow RDP connections to the JumpBox. In addition to creating resources, the ARM template also executes PowerShell scripts on each of the VMs to install software and configure the servers. The resources created by the ARM template include:

- A virtual network with three subnets, ManagedInstance, Management, and a Gateway subnet.
- A virtual network gateway associated with the Gateway subnet.
- A route table.
- Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI), added to the ManagedInstance subnet.
- A JumpBox with Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS installed, added to the Management subnet).
- A SQL Server 2008 R2 VM with the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) installed, added to the Management subnet.
- Azure Database Migration Service (DMS).
- Azure App Service Plan and App Service (Web App).
- Azure Blob Storage account.

> **Note**: You can review the steps to manually provision and configure the lab resources in the [Manual resource setup guide](./Manual-resource-setup.md).

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select the **Show portal menu** icon and then select **+Create a resource** from the menu.

   ![The Show portal menu icon is highlighted, and the portal menu is displayed. Create a resource is highlighted in the portal menu.](media/create-a-resource.png "Create a resource")

2. Before running the ARM template, it is beneficial to quickly verify that you can provision SQL MI in your subscription. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+Create a resource**, enter "sql managed instance" into the Search the Marketplace box, and then select **Azure SQL Managed Instance** from the results.

   ![+Create a resource is selected in the Azure navigation pane, and "sql managed instance" is entered into the Search the Marketplace box. Azure SQL Managed Instance is selected in the results.](media/create-resource-sql-mi.png "Create SQL Managed Instance")

3. Select **Create** on the Azure SQL Managed Instance blade.

   ![The Create button is highlighted on the Azure SQL Managed Instance blade.](media/sql-mi-create.png "Create Azure SQL Managed Instance")

4. On the SQL managed instance blade, look for a message stating that "Managed instance creation is not available for the chosen subscription type...", which will be displayed near the bottom of the SQL managed instance blade.

   ![A message is displayed stating that SQL MI creation not available in the selected subscription.](media/sql-mi-creation-not-available.png "SQL MI creation not available")

   > **Note**: If you see the message stating that Managed Instance creation is not available for the chosen subscription type, follow the instructions for [obtaining a larger quota for SQL Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-resource-limits#obtaining-a-larger-quota-for-sql-managed-instance) before proceeding with the following steps.

5. You are now ready to begin the ARM template deployment. To open a custom deployment screen in the Azure portal, select the Deploy to Azure button below:

   <a href ="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FMCW-Migrating-SQL-databases-to-Azure%2Fmaster%2FHands-on%20lab%2Flab-files%2FARM-template%2Fazure-deploy.json" target="_blank" title="Deploy to Azure">
   <img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
   </a>

   > **Note**: Running the ARM template occasionally results in a `ResourceDeploymentFailure` error, with a code of `VnetSubnetConflictedWithIntendedPolicy`. This error is not caused by an issue with the ARM template and appears to be the result of backend resource deployment issues in Azure. At this time, the workaround is first to try the deployment in a different region. If that does not work, try going through the [Manual resource setup guide](./Manual-resource-setup.md) to create the SQL MI database.

6. On the custom deployment screen in the Azure portal, enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource group**: Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group from the dropdown list.
   - **Region**: Select the region you used for the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.
   - **Managed Instance Name**: Accept the default value, **sqlmi**. The actual name must be globally unique, so a unique string is generated from your Resource Group and appended to the name during provisioning.
   - **Admin Username**: Accept the default value, **sqlmiuser**.
   - **Admin Password**: Accept the default value, **Password.1234567890**.
   - **V Cores**: Accept the default value, **4**.
   - **Storage Size in GB**: Accept the default value, **32**.

   ![The Custom deployment blade is displayed, and the information above is entered on the Custom deployment blade.](media/azure-custom-deployment.png "Custom deployment blade")

7. Select **Review + create** to review the custom deployment.

8. On the Review + create blade, ensure the _Validation passed_ message is displayed and then select **Create** to begin the custom deployment.

   ![On the Review + create blade for the custom deployment, the Validation passed message is highlighted, and the Create button is highlighted.](media/azure-custom-deployment-review-create.png "Review + create custom deployment")

   > **Note**: The deployment of the custom ARM template can take over 4 hours due to the inclusion of SQL MI. However, the deployment of most of the resources completes within a few minutes. The JumpBox and SQL Server 2008 R2 VMs should finish in about 15 minutes.

9. You can monitor the deployment's progress by navigating to the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group in the Azure portal and then selecting **Deployments** from the left-hand menu. The deployment is named **Microsoft.Template**. Select that to view the progress of each item in the template.

   ![The Deployments menu item is selected in the left-hand menu of the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group and the Microsoft.Template deployment is highlighted.](media/resource-group-deployments.png "Resource group deployments")

> Check back in a few hours to monitor the progress of your SQL MI provisioning. If the provisioning goes on for longer than 7 hours, you may need to issue a support ticket in the Azure portal to request the provisioning process be unblocked by Microsoft support.

You should follow all steps provided _before_ attending the Hands-on lab.
