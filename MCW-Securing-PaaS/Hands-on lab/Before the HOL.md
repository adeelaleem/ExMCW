# Securing PaaS before the hands-on lab setup guide 

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

    - Trial subscriptions will *not* work.
  
2.  A machine with the following software:

    -   Visual Studio 2017 Community edition or greater

**To ensure you can begin the course delivery on-time, you must take the following step at least 5-hours prior to the course start time:**

> **Note:** The Application Service Environment (ASE) and Web Application Firewall (WAF) can take more than 90-minutes to create depending on the load in the region.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

Synopsis: In this exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all the steps provided in the Before the Hands-on Lab section to prepare your environment *before* attending the workshop.

### Task 1: Download GitHub resources for Jump machine

In this task, you will download the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template required to setup this lab from a GitHub repository.

1.  Open a browser window to the cloud workshop GitHub repository (<https://github.com/Microsoft/mcw-securing-paas>).

2.  Select **Clone or download**, then select **Download Zip**.

    ![In the GitHub repository window, the Clone or download button and Download Zip link are selected.](images/Setup/image3.png "GitHub repository window")

3.  Extract the zip file to your local machine, be sure to keep note of where you have extracted the files.

### Task 2: Deploy resources to Azure

In this task, you will run the ARM template downloaded in the previous task in the Azure portal to provision the resources you will be using throughout this hands-on lab.

1.  In a browser, open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

    >**Note**: If prompted, select **Maybe Later**.

2.  Select **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, then select **+Add**.

    ![In the Azure Portal Resource groups pane, the Add button is selected.](images/Setup/image4.png "Azure Portal")

3.  Enter a **resource group** name, such as **paassecurity-\[your initials or first name\]**.

    ![The Resource Group blade displays.](images/Setup/image5.png "Resource Group blade")

4.  Select **Create**.

5.  Select **Refresh** to see your new resource group displayed and select it.

6.  Select **Automation Script**.

    ![The Automation Script option displays.](images/Setup/image6.png "Automation Script option")

7.  Select **Deploy**.

    ![The Deploy button displays.](images/Setup/image7.png "Deploy button")

8.  Select **Build your own template in the editor**.

9.  In the extracted folder, open the **\\Hands-on lab\\AzureTemplate\\azure-deploy.json**.

10. Copy and paste it into the window.

11. Select **Save**, you will see the dialog with the input parameters. Fill out the form:

    -   **Subscription**: Select your subscription.

    -   **Resource group**: Use an existing Resource group or create a new one by entering a unique name, such as **paassecurity-\[your initials or first name\]**.

    -   **Location**: Select a location for the Resource group. Recommend using East US, East US 2, West Central US, or West US 2.

    -   Modify the **parameters** to be something unique by replacing with your initials or something similar.

    -   Fill in the remaining parameters, but if you change anything be sure to note it for future reference throughout the lab.

    -   **Be sure your resource group location matches the location you select in the settings window**.

    >**Note**: This field and matching is due to a limitation of the resource templates not resolving the resource group location for some template types.

    ![A Dialog box displays with fields set to the previously mentioned settings. The Location, Passsecurity\_sql\_name and Location fields are all called out.](images/Setup/image8.png "Dialog box")

12. Check the **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above** checkbox.
