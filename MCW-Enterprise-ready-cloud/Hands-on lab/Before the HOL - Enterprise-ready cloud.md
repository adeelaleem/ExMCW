# Enterprise-ready cloud before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

- Full global admin access to the Azure AD tenant associated with your Azure subscription.

> **Note**: In this lab, [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview) is used for executing commands using the Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell. Both the Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell can be installed locally if needed. 

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 15 minutes

To complete this lab, you must have full global admin access to the Azure AD tenant associated with your Azure subscription.

### Task 1: Validate global admin access to Azure AD tenant

To validate that you have Global Administrator access to your Azure AD tenant, we will elevate access for a Global Administrator to allow for the management of Azure resources.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or the [Azure Active Directory admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com/) as a Global Administrator.

2. Expand the portal's left navigation by clicking **Show portal menu** in the top left.

3. In the navigation list, choose **Azure Active Directory** and then select **Properties**.

4. Under **Access management for Azure resources**, set the toggle to **Yes**.

    > **Note**: When you set the toggle to Yes, you are assigned the User Access Administrator role in Azure RBAC at the root scope (/). This grants you permission to assign roles in all Azure subscriptions and management groups associated with this Azure AD directory. This toggle is only available to users who are assigned the Global Administrator role in Azure AD.

5. Select **Save** to save your setting.

    > **Note**: This setting is not a global property and applies only to the currently signed in user. You can't elevate access for all members of the Global Administrator role.

6. In <http://portal.azure.com>, select **All Services**, and type in **Azure Active Directory**.

7. Sign out and sign back in to refresh your access.

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
