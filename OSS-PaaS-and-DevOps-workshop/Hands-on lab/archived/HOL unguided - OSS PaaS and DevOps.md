# OSS PaaS and DevOps hands-on lab unguided

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a solution for integrating and deploying complex Open Source Software (OSS) workloads into Azure PaaS. You will migrate an existing MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application from a hosted environment into Azure Web App for Containers, migrate a MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB, enhance application functionality using serverless technologies, and fully embrace modern DevOps tools.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to migrate and deploy OSS applications into Azure PaaS using modern DevOps methodologies and Docker containers.

## Overview

Best For You Organics Company is one of the leading health food suppliers in North America, serving customers in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. They have a MERN stack web application which they host on-premises and are looking to migrate their OSS application into Azure. They will be creating a custom Docker image for their application and using a Jenkins continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to deploy the application into a Web App for Containers instance. In addition, they will be setting up Azure Cosmos DB, using the MongoDB APIs, so they do not have to make application code changes to leverage the power of Cosmos DB.

In this hands-on lab, you will assist with completing the OSS application and database migrations into Azure. You will create a custom Docker image, provision an Azure Container Registry, push the image to the registry, and configure the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application to a Web App for Containers instance. You will also help them implement functionality enhancements using serverless architecture services in Azure.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This diagram consists of icons that are connected by arrows. On the left, the Developer icon (VS Code) points in a linear fashion to the GitHub Repo and Jenkins icons. The previous two icons are enclosed in a box labeled CI/CD Pipeline. Jenkins points to Web App for Containers on the right. Various arrows point from Web App for Container to: Azure Container Registry (a double-sided arrow); Logic Apps (a linear arrow that also points from Logic Apps to Customers); Customers (a linear arrow); and Azure Cosmos DB (a double-sided arrow that also points from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Functions with another double-sided arrow).](media/solution-architecture-diagram.png "Solution architecture diagram")

The solution begins with developers using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as their code editor, so they can leverage its rich integration with GitHub, Docker, and Azure. From a high level, developers will package the entire OSS application inside a custom Docker container using the Docker extension in VS Code. The image will be pushed to an Azure Container Registry as part of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub and Jenkins. This Docker image will then be deployed to a Web App for Containers instance, as part of their continuous delivery process using The Azure App Service Jenkins plugin.

The MongoDB database will be imported into Azure Cosmos DB, using mongoimport.exe, and access the database from the application will continue to use the MongoDB APIs. The database connection string in the application will be updated to point to the new Cosmos DB.

Serverless architecture will be applied to order processing and customer notifications. Azure Functions will be used to automate the processing of orders. Logic Apps will be applied to send SMS notifications, via a Twilio connector, to customers informing them that their order has been processed and shipped.
