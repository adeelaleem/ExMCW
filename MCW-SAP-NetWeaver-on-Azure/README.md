## Target audience
- Infrastructure Architect

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop you will learn to deploy and configure SAP on Azure infrastructure and SAP NetWeaver deployment running on Azure infrastructure, including SAP NetWeaver ASCS and SAP NetWeaver database servers. Key takeaways are the Azure infrastructure solution components and the way they are put together to run SAP applications as well as the Solution architecture references.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to design and deploy SAP running on Azure infrastructure as a service components and understand proper configuration of SAP NetWeaver ASCS, database and application servers in Azure.

### Whiteboard design session 

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn how to deploy SAP on Azure infrastructure components as well as perform an SAP on Azure need assessment, take part in an SAP on Azure architecture design discussion, and respond to an RFI/RFP for SAP on Cloud opportunity.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to architect for SAP running on Azure infrastructure as a service components and understand proper configuration of SAP NetWeaver ASCS, database and application servers in Azure.

### Hands-on lab 

In this hands-on lab you will setup and configure SAP NetWeaver on Azure infrastructure as a service component. You will setup identity management, Scale-Out File Server (SOFS), NetWeaver application and database tiers and configure them all in a domain. You will then setup high-availability by configuring failover clustering for the SAP ASCS servers. Finally, you will configure the database tier with Always-On Availability Groups and configure the NetWeaver application servers for redundancy and enhanced monitoring.

At the end of the hands-on-lab, you will be better able to deploy SAP on Azure infrastructure components, configure SAP NetWeaver ASCS servers, configure SAP NetWeaver database servers, and configure SAP NetWeaver Application servers.
