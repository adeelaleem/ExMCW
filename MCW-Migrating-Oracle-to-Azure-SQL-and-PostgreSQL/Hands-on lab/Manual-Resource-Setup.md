# Migrating Oracle to Azure SQL and PostgreSQL before the hands-on lab setup guide (manual steps)

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
- A virtual machine configured with:
  - Visual Studio 2019 Community (latest release)

In this lab, there are three major migration paths:

  - Migrating Oracle to Azure SQL
  - Migrating SQL Server 2008 R2 Data Warehouse to Azure SQL (*homogenous* migration)
  - Migrating Oracle to Azure Database for PostgreSQL

Regardless of which path(s) you complete, follow Tasks 1-3. After that, the Task titles indicate which migration paths they are intended for.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 45 minutes

In the Before the Hands-on Lab Manual Resource Setup document, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. Note that we recommend the standard Before the Hands-on Lab document, as the ARM template facilitates a simpler, automated deployment. You should follow all the steps provided to prepare your environment **before attending** the hands-on lab. Failure to do so will significantly impact your ability to complete the lab within the time allowed.

> **Important**: Most Azure resources require unique names. Throughout this lab, you will see the word “SUFFIX” as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the resource is uniquely named.

### Task 1: Provision a resource group

In this task, you will create an Azure resource group for the resources used throughout this lab.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

    ![Resource groups are highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. On the Resource groups blade, select **+Add**.

    ![+Add is highlighted in the toolbar on the Resource groups blade.](media/resource-groups-add.png "Resource groups")

3. Enter the following in the Create an empty resource group blade:

    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
    - **Resource group**: Enter hands-on-lab-SUFFIX.
    - **Region**: Select the region you would like to use for resources in this hands-on lab. Remember this location so you can use it for the other resources you'll provision throughout this lab.

    ![Add Resource group Resource groups is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, +Add is highlighted in the Resource groups blade, and "hands-on-labs" is entered into the Resource group name box on the Create an empty resource group blade.](./media/create-resource-group.png "Create resource group")

4. Select **Review + Create**.

5. On the Review + Create tab, select **Create** to provision the resource group.

### Task 2: Create lab virtual machine

In this task, you will provision a virtual machine (VM) in Azure. The VM image used will have Visual Studio Community 2019 installed.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select the **Show portal menu** icon and then select **+Create a resource** from the menu.

    ![The Show portal menu icon is highlighted and the portal menu is displayed. Create a resource is highlighted in the portal menu.](media/create-a-resource.png "Create a resource")

    You should see the script executing.

    ![Image shows the initial PowerShell web request executing.](media/orapg-powershell-script-executing.png "PowerShell executing")

2. Install the ora2pg utility dependencies.

   - Install Perl. It will take five minutes.
   - Install the Oracle client library and SDK. To do this, you will first need to navigate to [Oracle Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/winx64-64-downloads.html). Then, scroll to **Version 12.2.X**. Select the installer for the **Basic Package**.
   - Download the zip file.

    ![Screenshot to show downloading the basic package.](./media/basic-package.png "Basic package download")

3. On the same Oracle link as above under the **version** section, locate the **SDK Package** installer under the **Development and Runtime - optional packages** section. Keep the zipped file in the Downloads directory.

    ![Screenshot to show the SDK Package download.](./media/sdk-package.png "SDK package download")

4. Navigate to the directory where the zipped instant client packages reside.

    - For the basic package, right-click it, and select **Extract All...**.
    - When prompted to choose the destination directory, navigate to the `C:\` location.
    - Select **Extract**.
    - Repeat this process for the zipped SDK.

    ![Screenshot to show the process of installing client and SDK Packages.](./media/installing-basic-instantclient-package.png "Client and SDK package downloads")

    Your folder path should show:

    ![The image shows the folder path to the client and the SDK.](media/extract-sdk-client-validation.png "Correct path to the SDK and Instant Client")

5. Install the Git client and ora2pg utility.  
    - Return to the PowerShell script.
    - Press any key to terminate the script's execution, if the PS window is still visible.
    - Open Explorer and rename the  `C:\instantclient_12_2` folder to `C:\instantclient`.
    - Launch the script one more time for install path validation purposes.
    - If the previous steps were successful, the script should be able to locate **oci.dll** under `C:\instantclient\oci.dll`.

        >**Note**: If the script still cannot find `oci.dll`, rename the Instant Client extract folder name to `C:\instantclient` exactly.

    ![The image shows the script expects an exact Instant Client install path.](media/ps-validation-path-instant-client.png "Instant Client install path")

    If the path is correct, you should see the script downloading the Git installer.

    ![The image shows the Git installer downloading.](media/ps-downloading-git-installer.png "Downloading Git installer")

    >**Note**: The script may throw errors of not being able to find a Git executable at a certain location. This should not impact the installation.

    A successful installation should have a PowerShell screen that resembles this:

    ![The image shows a successful Git and ora2pg installation](media/ps-successful-git-ora2pg-installation.png "Git and ora2pg installation")

6. Once ora2pg installs, you will need to configure PATH variables.

    - Search for **View advanced system settings** in Windows.
    - Select the result, and the **System Properties** dialog box should open.
    - By default, the **Advanced** tab should be showing, but if not, navigate to it.
    - Then, select **Environment Variables...**.

    ![Screenshot showing process to enter environment labels.](./media/enter-environment-variables.png "Environment Variables selected")

7. Under **System variables**, select **Path**. Select **Edit...**.

    ![Screenshot to show editing the path variables.](./media/selecting-path.png "Selecting the PATH variables")

8. The **Edit environment variable** box should be displaying.

    - Select **New**.
    - Enter **C:\instantclient**.
    - Repeat this process, but enter **%%PATH%%** instead.

    ![Screenshot showing path variable configuration.](./media/path-variable-configuration.png "Path variable configuration")

6. Select **Review + Create**.

7. On the Review + Create tab, select **Create** to provision the Azure SQL Database.

    > **Note**: The [Azure SQL Database firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure) prevents external applications and tools from connecting to the server or any database on the server unless a firewall rule is created to open the firewall for the specific IP address. When creating the new server above, the **Allow azure services to access server** setting was allowed, which allows any services using an Azure IP address to access this server and databases, so there is no need to create a specific firewall rule for this hands-on lab. To access the SQL server from an on-premises computer or application, you need to [create a server-level firewall rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-get-started-portal#create-a-server-level-firewall-rule) to allow the specific IP addresses to access the server.

### Task 14 (Migrate to Azure SQL Optional Homogenous Migration): Create an Azure SQL Database for the Data Warehouse

If you are completing the optional homogenous migration, complete this task to create the landing zone for the Data Warehouse migration.

1. Repeat the steps in the previous task, creating a new database called `WideWorldImportersDW`. **However, do not create a new server! Select the existing server that you created in the last Task.**

    ![Creating the WideWorldImportersDW database on the existing northwind-server-SUFFIX Azure SQL server.](./media/creating-sql-database-homogenous-migration.png "Creating data warehouse Azure SQL database on the existing server")

An Azure SQL Database *server* is just a management entity, akin to how multiple SQL Server databases reside on an individual SQL Server instance.

### Task 15 (Migrate to Azure SQL Optional Homogenous Migration): Register the Microsoft DataMigration resource provider

   - **Administrator username**: `solldba`
   - **Password**: Provide a secure password

    Select the **Review + create** button once you are ready.

    ![Configuring the instance details.](./media/postgresql-provision-parameters.png "Project Details window with pertinent details")

4. Select **Create** to start the deployment. Once the deployment completes, we will move on to configuring the instance.

### Task 18 (Migrate to PostgreSQL): Configure the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Instance

In this task, we will be modifying the PostgreSQL instance to fit our needs.

1. Storage Auto-growth is a feature in which Azure will add more storage automatically when required. We do not need it for our purposes so we will need to disable it. To do this, locate the PostgreSQL instance you created. Under the **Settings** tab, select **Pricing tier**.

    ![Changing the pricing tier in PostGre SQL instance.](./media/changing-tier.png "Pricing tier")

2. Find the **Storage Auto-growth** switch, and disable the feature. Select **OK** at the bottom of the page to save your change.

    ![Disabling storage auto-growth feature.](./media/disabling-auto-grow.png  "Storage auto-growth toggled to no")

3. Now, we need to implement firewall rules for the PostgreSQL database so we can access it. Locate the **Connection security** selector under the **Settings** tab.

    ![Configuring the Connection Security settings for the database.](./media/entering-connection-settings.png "Connection security highlighted")

4. We will add a network access rule. Since we are storing insecure test data, select **Allow access to Azure services**. This means that all public IP addresses associated with Azure have network access to the PostgreSQL instance, even if they are located in other subscriptions or tenants.

    ![Allow Azure resources access to the PostgreSQL instance.](./media/allow-azure-services-network-access.png "Grant Azure resources PostgreSQL network access")

    >**Note**: Do not use this type of rule for databases with sensitive data or in a production environment. You are allowing access from any Azure IP address.

### Task 19 (Migrate to PostgreSQL): Create an App Service Instance

As part of the PostgreSQL lab, you will host the modified application in Azure App Service. You will provision a Web App and an App Service Plan in this Task.

1. On the **New** page, navigate to **Web** under **Azure Marketplace**. Select **Web App**.
