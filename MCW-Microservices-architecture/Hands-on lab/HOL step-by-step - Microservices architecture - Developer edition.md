# Microservices architecture -- Developer edition hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will construct an end-to-end Proof of concept for ticket ordering based on a microservices architecture based on Service Fabric and Azure Functions, alongside other supporting Azure features such as API Management, Web Apps, Azure Active Directory and Cosmos DB.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will better be able to build solutions that leverage these Azure features, in addition to gaining experience with deploying, scaling, upgrading and rolling back Service Fabric applications.

## Overview

Contoso Events is an online service for concerts, sporting and other event ticket sales. They are redesigning their solution for scale with a microservices strategy and want to implement a POC for the path that receives the most traffic: ticket ordering.

In this hands-on lab, you will construct an end-to-end POC for ticket ordering. You will leverage Service Fabric, API Management, Function Apps, Web Apps, and Cosmos DB.

![The Event Ticket sales flowchart begins with Azure AD B2C, which points to Contoso Events Site Web App. A bi-directional arrow points between the Web App and API Manager, which in turn has bi-directional arrows pointing between it and the Events microservice and the Orders microservice. Two bi-directional arrows point from the microservices to the Container Registry.  The Orders microservice has an arrow that points to Order Externalization (Queue), then on to Process Order Externalization (Azure Function), and ends at Cosmos DB (Events and Orders). ](media/image2.png "Event Ticket sales flowchart")

## Solution architecture

The following figures are intended to help you keep track of all the technologies and endpoints you are working with in this hands-on lab. The first figure is the overall architecture, indicating the Azure resources to be employed. The second figure is a more detailed picture of the key items you will want to remember about those resources as you move through the exercises.

![Diagram of the preferred solution (just one of many viable options). From a high-level, Contoso Events applications will consume back-end APIs managed through API Management, authenticating users with tokens issued by Azure AD B2C. API requests will go through Azure Load Balancer, and distribute across Service Fabric nodes. Business functionality will be implemented through stateful services and actors, and Azure Functions will handle processing the queues and updating Cosmos DB.](media/image3.png "Preferred solution diagram")

 ![This illustration lists key items to remember, which include: Profiles, Application, Queues, TicketManager DB, Functions, APIM Endpoints, Web App, Cluster Endpoints, and Local Endpoints. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the illustration. Future versions of this course should address this.](media/image4.png "Key items to remember illustration")

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

    -   Trial subscriptions will not work.

2.  A virtual machine configured with (see Before the hands-on lab):

    -   Visual Studio 2019 Community edition, or later

    -   Azure Development workload enabled in Visual Studio 2019 (enabled by default on the VM)

    -   Service Fabric SDK 3.3 or later for Visual Studio

    -   Google Chrome browser (Swagger commands do not work in IE)
    
    -   Docker for Windows
    
    -   PowerShell 3.0 or higher (v5.1 already installed on VM)

## Exercise 1: Environment setup

Duration: 30 minutes

Contoso Events has provided a starter solution for you. They have asked you to use this as the starting point for creating the Ticket Order POC solution with Service Fabric.

Because this is a "born in Azure" solution, it depends on many Azure resources. You will be guided through creating those resources before you work with the solution in earnest. The following figure illustrates the resource groups and resources you will create in this exercise.

![The Starter Solution begins with a Start button, with two arrows pointing to two different Resource Groups. The first Resource group includes only the Function App. The second Resource group includes the following resources: Service Fabric Cluster, API Management, Azure AD B2C, Web App, Storage Account, Cosmos DB and Container Registry.](media/image42.png "Starter Solution Resources")

## Exercise 2: Microservices containerization
Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will create the Docker images for each of the microservices in the solution.

### Task 1: Inspect the Dockerfile files

1.  In Visual Studio, open the Dockerfile located in the ContosoEvents.Api.Events project.

2.  The Dockerfile contains all the required steps to build the Docker image for the Events microservice.  As you can see in the first line of code, it is based on the mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2-stretch-slim Linux-based Docker image.  On the other hand, it uses the mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2-stretch image to compile and publish the Events microservice project.

3.  Open the Dockerfile located in the ContosoEvents.Api.Orders project.

4.  Likewise, this Dockerfile is based on the mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2-stretch-slim Linux-based Docker image.  It also uses the mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2-stretch image to compile and publish the Orders microservice project.

### Task 2: Build the Docker images

1.  Open a Command Prompt by clicking the Start menu then typing cmd.

2.  Change the directory to C:\MCW-Microservices-architecture-master\Source\ContosoEventsPoC-DeveloperEdition\Src.

3.  In the Src folder as the root, type the following command in the Command Prompt: `docker build --tag [YOUR CONTAINER REGISTRY].azurecr.io/contosoevents-events:latest --file ContosoEvents.Api.Events\Dockerfile .`  Replace [YOUR CONTAINER REGISTRY] with the container registry name that you selected in Exercise 1, Task 7, Step 2.  Press Enter to execute the command and start the Docker container image creation process for the Events microservice.

    ![In the Command Prompt, the docker build command is executed and all the steps are being executed](media/dockerbuild-events.png "Solution Explorer window")

4.  Still in the Src folder as the root, type the following command in the Command Prompt: `docker build --tag [YOUR CONTAINER REGISTRY].azurecr.io/contosoevents-orders:latest --file ContosoEvents.Api.Orders\Dockerfile .`  Replace [YOUR CONTAINER REGISTRY] with the container registry name that you selected in Exercise 1, Task 7, Step 2.  Press Enter to execute the command and start the Docker container image creation process for the Orders microservice.

    ![In the Command Prompt, the docker build command is executed and all the steps are being executed](media/dockerbuild-orders.png "Command Prompt window")
    
### Task 3: Inspect the Docker images

1.  In the Command Prompt, type the following command: `docker images` and press Enter to execute.

2.  The `images` parameter of the `docker` tool will show all the images stored in your local repository.  At this point, you should have both [YOUR CONTAINER REGISTRY].azurecr.io/contosoevents-events:latest and [YOUR CONTAINER REGISTRY].azurecr.io/contosoevents-orders:latest images at a minimum.

    ![In the Command Prompt, the docker images command is executed and all the container images stored locally are being shown.](media/dockerimages.png "Command Prompt window")

## Exercise 3: Push the container images to Azure Container Registry  

Duration: 15 minutes

### Task 1: Logon into the Container Registry

1.  In the Azure Portal, select the Resource groups option in the side menu, then select the **hands-on-lab** resource group from the list.

2.  In the hands-on-lab blade, select the contosoeventsSUFFIX container registry that you created on Exercise 1, Task 7.  For easy access, you can use the filter dropdown list and select only ' Container registries' option in the list.

    ![In the hands-on-lab blade, the Container registries filter is circled.  At the bottom, the contosoeventsSUFFIX Container registry is circled.](media/acr3.png "hands-on-lab blade")
    
3.  In the Container registry blade, select the Access keys from the menu.

    ![In the Container registry blade, the Access keys menu item is circled.](media/acr4.png "Container registry blade")
    
4.  In the Access keys blade, copy both the username and password in a Notepad.  You will use this credential values to login on the Azure Container Registry from Docker.

    ![In the Access keys blade, the username and password are circled.](media/acr5.png "Container registry - Access keys blade")
    
5.  Open a Command Prompt window.

6.  Type the following command `docker login [YOUR CONTAINER REGISTRY].azurecr.io`.  Replace [YOUR CONTAINER REGISTRY] with the name that you selected in Exercise 1, Task 7.  Press Enter to execute the command.

7.  When prompted, paste the username and password to login.
