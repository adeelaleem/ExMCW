# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

- Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

-  Stimulates the participant's thinking.

-  Involves the participant in the learning process.

- Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

- Ensures individual participant accountability.

- Ties it all together for the participant.

- Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

- Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

- Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

- Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow 

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

- Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

- Current customer infrastructure and architecture

- Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

- Determine your target customer audience.

- Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

- Present solution

- Respond to customer objections

- Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

- Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

#  SQL Server hybrid cloud whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this whiteboard design session, you will look at how to design an application for hybrid deployment between on-premises and Microsoft Azure. You will consider how the web tier must be made available in the event of an outage as well as how to configure SQL Server Always-on Availability Groups to deploy and failover between both locations.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design a hybrid disaster recovery solution between an on-premises VMWare environment and Azure. In addition, you will design a SQL Server scale-out solution, protect database backups from local failures, archive cold data from an on-premises SQL Server, and perform end-to-end encryption on sensitive application data.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions:  With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1. Meet your table participants and trainer.

2. Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3. As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Fabrikam Publishing is a media and publishing company in Seattle, Washington with approximately 5000 employees. They have a successful direct-to-consumer e-commerce site built with .NET, and they use SQL Server to store customer profile and order information.
Fabrikam has a single data center for both internal and customer-facing applications. Most servers are virtualized on VMware. Application servers primarily run Microsoft server software, including Active Directory (AD) Domain Services and a number of AD-integrated services including Exchange 2013 as well as multi-tier, internal, and AD-integrated Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) based web applications with SQL Server 2017 as the database platform.

Recently, the site experienced a multi-day outage due to a lightning strike that disabled both the primary and secondary cooling systems at the data center. In order to avoid such long outages in the future, Fabrikam is investing in a secondary site for disaster recovery. "A disaster recovery site has been on our project proposals for the last four years, but it has always been shelved due to budget constraints," says Michelle Jenkins, Chief Information Officer (CIO). "The recent outage combined with the new capabilities in the cloud have finally encouraged the board to approve the additional budget necessary to build out our disaster recover (DR) capabilities." To keep capital expenditures in check, Fabrikam would like to use the public cloud to host its DR site.

James Sherburn, Director of Information Technology Operations, describes Fabrikam's current disaster recovery strategy as a classic backup/restore strategy with no offsite warm standby machines. Backups are dumped on a network share, and these backups are then archived once per day to an offsite location. There is no enterprise backup solution in place. According to Sherburn, this strategy requires an "all hands-on deck" approach to recovering the site, which is resource-intensive and slow. It also requires significant expense to bring temporary hardware online at a remote, vendor-provided data center. Because of the cost and complexity, this disaster recovery plan has never been tested, and Information Technology (IT) is not confident that it could bring up the secondary site in a reasonable amount of time. This lack of confidence in the current DR strategy prevented IT management from implementing a failover during the last disaster, resulting in significant losses for the company.

The application team is concerned that the database DR solution will have a negative impact on the overall database performance. The website currently experiences periodic database latency issues during peak load. They would like to have a solution that improves performance of the predominantly read workloads generated by the website to improve the overall responsiveness and the user experience. The Database Architect, Brandon Burns, saw a presentation at a conference last year on leveraging SQL Server Always On availability groups with readable secondaries to offload read workloads. Brandon said, "Our ideal solution would be a scale out solution for the data platform, however, we are concerned about potentially making a lot of application code changes." We need a solution that minimizes the amount of changes in the application, and we would like to investigate SQL Server Always On availability groups and readable secondaries.

The database administration team is worried about future Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance issues related to data that is currently stored in varchar fields in the database. In the current system, the database is inaccessible from outside the application except through a dedicated administrative jump-box. Implementing a DR site means that we will be transferring data, and they want to make sure that PCI data being transferred is encrypted. They are concerned about cloud security and the implications it may have to their annual PCI audits. To mitigate any perceived risk and shortcut any issues that may be raised in the PCI audit, they would like to encrypt ALL of the PCI data at both the application and database level.

Future application plans call for new applications that will need to access the encrypted PCI/PII data stored in the database. Key management should be handled by the Fabrikam Security Administration team. They will be responsible for protecting and managing the keys. They need a solution that enables them to accomplish this goal across the multiple applications that will potentially leverage the encrypted database without revealing unencrypted production keys to DBAs or developers.

An additional concern is that the database maintenance jobs are exceeding the current maintenance window. Robert Moore, Manager of Database Administration, believes this is due to the lack of an archive strategy on the current order related tables. Backup times have gradually increased over time to the point where they exceed the maintenance window. Moore's other concern is the sheer size of these databases could make initial synchronization or resynchronization of the DR site a long process that could result in the site running in an exposed state for extended periods. Currently, the database holds approximately 10 years' worth of data. "Data older than one year is rarely accessed," says Moore. The business has resisted any data archiving because of several reports that periodically need access to the historical data.

Finally, Fabrikam has a requirement to store the database backups offsite in an encrypted format within two hours of backup completion and they need insight into when backups are not occurring across all databases in the environment, they currently rely on manual configuration of SQL Agent jobs to run backups and management is concerned that not all databases are being backed up appropriately. The current backup strategy consists of SQL Server backups to an on-premises file server; the backups are then copied to tape and shipped offsite. This process can take up to 24 hours to secure the tapes offsite. In addition to being slow, the tape backups are notoriously unreliable and are generally not available for ad hoc access in the case that a restore becomes necessary. Fabrikam would like to have these backups secured offsite within two hours of the backup completing and a centralized backup management and monitoring solution.

### Customer needs 

1. A full multi-site disaster recovery solution with minimal complexity, orchestrated failover, and near-zero data loss.

2. Highly available, fault-tolerant SQL Server service with cross-site disaster recovery and minimal impact on database performance.

3. Scale-out the data platform utilizing SQL Server Always On availability groups with readable secondaries to offload the heavy read workloads from the primary replica with minimal changes to the application.

4. The ability to seamlessly scale DR site infrastructure as the environment grows.

5. Data encryption solution that encrypts only PCI data at the application and database level.

6. Key management solution that does not expose the unencrypted keys to unauthorized personnel (including database administrators and developers) and allows for key management by the security administration team.

7. Data archiving to keep database sizes more manageable and reduce the amount of time needed for database maintenance.

8. Centralized management and monitoring of backups with secure offsite backups.

### Customer objections 

1. Solution must support orchestrated failover so that failover does not require an all hands-on deck.

2. Solution must support the existing VMware infrastructure.

3. Solution must not have a significant impact on database performance.

4. DR infrastructure must be easily scalable to support changes in the workload.

5. The disaster recovery sites must be highly available after a failover.

6. We have seen some documentation surrounding the use of Availability Zones in Azure. What does Availability Zones provide over and above Availability Sets? Would this be a good option for us?

7. Archive solution must not impact the current applications that periodically pull historical data from the production system.

8. We need to be able to backup databases both on-premises and in the cloud. How will your backup solution support this?

##  Preferred target audience

- Michelle Jenkins, Chief Information Officer

- James Sherburn, Director, IT Operations

- Robert Moore, Manager, Database Administration

- Brandon Burns, Database Architect, Enterprise Architecture

## Preferred solution

The solution for Fabrikam's scenario involved several technologies.

- Implementing Azure Site Recovery to replicate VMware virtual machines to Azure and orchestrate failover in the event of a disaster.

- Using SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups to provide synchronous high availability on-premises.

- Using SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups to provide asynchronous disaster recovery in Azure.

- Take advantage of SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups with readable secondaries and read-intent routing to offload the heavy read workloads.

- Using SQL Server Always Encrypted to encrypt and decrypt PCI data at the application to protect data in-flight or at rest with keys stored in Azure Key Vault.

- Using SQL Server Stretch Database to archive historical data to Azure SQL Database.

- Leverage Azure Backup for centralized management and monitoring of backups.

- Using Azure Traffic Manager with Azure Site Recovery for availability of customer-facing sites.

***Plan for high availability and disaster recovery***

1. **Orchestrated failover**: Fabrikam needs to automate and simplify the failover process for the web site. Design a solution that supports orchestrated failover of the entire site. 

   Azure Site Recovery will be used to protect the web farm and orchestrate failover in the event of a disaster.

2. **Additional infrastructure:** Address what additional infrastructure Fabrikam would need to enable the stated solution.

   An on-premises process server that acts as a replication gateway. It receives data from protected source machines, optimizes it with caching, compression, and encryption, and it sends replication data to Azure storage. It also handles push installation of Mobility service to protected machines and performs automatic discovery of VMware VMs. The disaster recovery virtual machines in Azure will remain offline until failover. Replicated data will be sent directly to the VHD files sitting in Azure Storage.

   To enable Azure Site Recovery, the following is required:

   The Mobility service is deployed on each machine (VMware VM or physical server) that you want to replicate to Azure. It captures data writes on the machine and forwards them to the process server. See <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises>.

   You will also need Active Directory on the secondary recovery site for SQL Server to run properly. A couple of options are available:

- Small enterprise:  If you have a small number of applications and a single domain controller for the on-premises site, and you want to fail over the entire site, we recommend you use Site Recovery replication to replicate the domain controller to the secondary datacenter or to Azure.

- Medium to large enterprise:  If you have a large number of applications, are running an Active Directory forest, and want to fail over by application or workload, we recommend you set up an additional domain controller in the secondary datacenter or in Azure. Note that if you are using AlwaysOn availability groups to recover to a remote site, we recommend you set up another additional domain controller on the secondary site or Azure to use for the recovered SQL Server instance.

3. **SQL Server:** The DR solution for SQL Server should include near-zero data loss. Design the DR solution to provide near-zero data loss along with minimal overhead on normal transactions.

    The SQL Server databases will be protected by SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups. For on-premises high availability, we will use Synchronous Availability Groups with automatic failover. This allows for zero data loss, high availability in the event of a single node failure or during maintenance. The automatic failover will require the use of an additional file share witness on site.

    The disaster recovery SQL Server virtual machine in Azure will be an asynchronous replica of the availability group. Failover to an asynchronous replica is always forced, as there is a potential for data loss. In the event of a failover, Azure Site Recovery will orchestrate the failover through the use of a Recovery Plan, which will run the necessary scripts to failover the SQL Server. See the "Integrate with SQL Server Always On for replication to Azure" section of this article <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-sql>.

4. **Availability:** The site should be highly available, even after failover to the disaster site. Explain how your design meets these goals after failover.

    For connectivity to the public-facing sites, Azure Traffic Manager will be configured in failover mode.

    Traffic Manager will be configured on two external endpoints (the existing on-premises site and a site that you will pre-configure in DNS for when ASR fails over). When Traffic Manager detects an outage on the primary on-premises site, it will failover DNS resolution to the pre-configured site in Azure.

 > **Note**: *As long as the attendees understand this far, they are doing great. Implementation notes are here for the full details: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/reduce-rto-by-using-azure-traffic-manager-with-azure-site-recovery/>.*  For SQL Server connectivity from the application servers, SQL Server Always On availability groups uses a Listener for client connectivity.

***Scale out data platform***

1. **Scale out**: The solution should provide a scale out data platform to offload the heavy read workload to secondary servers.

   The SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Group will be extended to include additional async readable secondaries. The application will leverage read-intent routing to take advantage of the readable secondaries.

2. **User experience**: Address the user experience issues of the data tier. How will this solution address this?

   The application sees performance issues under heavy read workloads. Leveraging multiple readable secondaries and read-intent routing allows us to spread the heavy read workloads out across all of the replicas minimizing the impact on any one server.

3. **Application impact**: What impact will your design have on the existing application?

   Application code does not have to be rewritten, so no changes will need to be made to application code, only to the connection strings. The application should see improved performance due to the offloading of the heavy read workload to the AlwaysOn Availability Group secondaries.

***Protect data***

1. **Encrypt PCI data:** Choose an appropriate encryption technology to protect credit card related data.

   Since we need to protect data in-flight, we will use SQL Server Always Encrypted. Always Encrypted allows clients to encrypt sensitive data inside client applications. An Always Encrypted-enabled driver installed on the client computer achieves this by automatically encrypting and decrypting sensitive data in the client application. The driver encrypts the data in sensitive columns before passing the data to the Database Engine, and the driver automatically rewrites queries, so the semantics to the application are preserved. Similarly, the driver transparently decrypts data stored in encrypted database columns and contained in query results.

2. **Key management**: How are the encryption keys managed in your design?

   Always Encrypted uses two types of keys: Column master keys and column encryption keys. A column master key (CMK) is a key encrypting key (i.e. a key used to encrypt other keys) that is always in the client's control and is stored in an external key store. A column encryption key (CEK), is a content encryption key (i.e. a key used to protect data) protected by a CMK. Both encryption keys should be generated on a separate computer either dedicated for key management or is a machine hosting application that will need access to the keys anyway.

   It is common for keys to be rotated to comply with organizational policies or in case an encryption key is compromised. There are two high-level key rotation work-flows; rotating column master keys, and rotating column encryption keys.

   Column master key rotation involves decrypting column encryption keys that are protected with the current column master key, re-encrypting them using the new column master key, and updating the metadata for both types of keys. Column master key rotation can be completed with or without role separation (role separation is where a security or system admin has access to the keys but not the data and a database administrator has access to the data but not the keys). In Fabrikam's case they specifically asked for role separation to prevent exposure of unencrypted keys to DBAs and developers.

   Column encryption key rotation involves decrypting data that is encrypted with the current key, and re-encrypting the data using the new column encryption key. Because rotating a column encryption key requires access to both the keys and the database, column encryption key rotation can only be performed without role separation. Note that, rotating a column encryption key can take a long time if the tables containing columns are encrypted with the key, being rotated, are large. While the data is being re-encrypted, your applications cannot write to the impacted tables. Therefore, your organization needs to carefully plan a column encryption key rotation.

   Facilitating additional applications to access the encrypted data in the database can be accomplished by storing the keys in Azure Key Vault. Applications can be registered in Azure AD and given access to Azure Key Vault. The application can then be modified to pull the encryption keys from Azure Key Vault as opposed to storing the keys locally.

3. **Application impact**: What impact will your design have on the existing application?

   Application code will need to be updated to support pulling the key from Azure Key Vault. The application servers' client drivers will need to be updated to a compatible driver.

4. **Encryption type**: Create a table that shows each type of PCI data and the appropriate type of encryption for each.

   There are two types of encryption with Always Encrypted; deterministic and random. Deterministic encryption always generates the same encrypted value for any given plain text value. Using deterministic encryption allows point lookups, equality joins, grouping and indexing on encrypted columns. However, it may also allow unauthorized users to guess information about encrypted values by examining patterns in the encrypted column. Randomized encryption uses a method that encrypts data in a less predictable manner. Randomized encryption is more secure, but prevents searching, grouping, indexing, and joining on encrypted columns.

   Credit card processing has numerous data elements. You want searchable data elements to be deterministic to support point lookups, equality joins, grouping and indexing. Any other data can be random. Below is an example of some of the critical data elements as defined by PCI and how you might map them to different encryption types. 

    |         |            |
    | ------------- |:-------------:|
    | **Data Element** | **Encryption Type** |
    | Primary Account Number (PAN)    | Randomized  |
    | Cardholder Name    | Deterministic  |
    | Service Code    | Randomized  |
    | Expiration Date    | Deterministic  |

***Data archiving: Keeping cold/historical data online***

1. **Planning**: What questions would you pose to the customer in designing a data archive strategy? What is the retention period of the data? How many large tables are there in the database? How many large tables are there in the database?

   Customer data should be kept for 7 years. When customers come to the site, their order history for the last 7 years is available to them from the site.

   The tables to be archived are insert-only order tables. If an order is modified after the data is inserted into the table, it is represented as a new version of the order making the data in the table immutable.

   In this case, there are several large tables, but only the order-related tables are suitable for our archive strategy: the *orders* table and the *order\_detail* table.

2. **Identify archive data**: Describe how you would identify the appropriate tables for archiving.

   Generally, you only want to archive data that is not queried frequently and that will not be modified. The SQL Server Upgrade Advisor includes the Stretch Database Advisor utility to help identify databases and tables for Stretch Database. The utility allows you to modify the minimum size and row count parameters to expand or shrink the list of recommended tables. It also lists any blocking issues found for each table.

3. **Impact**: What impact will your design have on the existing reporting system? How will this solution effect the current maintenance issues?

   The existing reporting system will not need any modifications after implementing Stretch Database. Queries that include Stretch-enabled tables are expected to perform more slowly than they did before the tables were enabled for Stretch.

   By migrating a large portion of the data into Azure SQL Database, the regular maintenance should improve dramatically. Backups will only back up and index maintenance will have a significantly smaller data set to work with.

4. **Diagram the solution**

***Offsite backup***

1. **Database backups**: What backup technology would you recommend? How does the solution meet the offsite requirements? How does this design meet the stated security goals?

   Azure Backup is a natural fit for Fabrikam's requirements. Azure Backup stores backups in an Azure Recovery Services vault. Database backups leverage the native SQL APIs so that customers get the benefit of SQL backup compression, full fidelity backup and restore including full, differential and log backups. Customers can monitor backups through SQL Server Management Studio or the Recovery Services Vault dashboard. 

2. **Provide the following configuration details:** What configuration will be required for this backup solution to support both cloud and on-premises SQL Servers?

    - For backup of cloud-based SQL Server virtual machines, Azure Backup will require a Recovery Services vault in the same region. You can have only one backup solution at a time to back up SQL Server databases. All other backups must be disabled otherwise they will interfere with Azure Backup generated backups causing failures.

    - Azure virtual machines will need network connectivity to Azure public IP addresses. This can be accomplished by whitelisting the Azure datacenter IP ranges on the firewall or by deploying an HTTP proxy server and routing traffic for the backup extension to the proxy server.

    - Install the AzureBackupWindowsWorkload extension on each virtual machine that will be backed up. Discover databases using the Recovery Services vault and configure the backups by defining a new policy for backups.

    - For on-premises servers we will use Azure Backup Server installed to a dedicated, domain joined machine. You will register this Azure Backup Server with a Recovery Services vault, which will allow you to download and install the Azure Backup Server, configure the backup for the on-premises workload and download the vault credentials.

    - On-premises servers will need to have the Data Protection Manager protection agent installed. This can be installed via Backup Server Administration Console.

   If a backup of a TDE encrypted database needs to be restored, you will first need to restore the certificate used by TDE.

   Restore times will be influenced by network throughput. Restore times for databases on on-premises servers may be slower than restoring from a local disk, but faster than restoring from a remote tape archive. To optimize restore times, it is recommended that you adhere to the following best practices:

    - Add **perform volume maintenance tasks** user right to the SQL Server account to allow instant file initialization for the database during a restore

    - Use compressed backups to minimize network transfer and disk read from Azure

    - For backups in excess of 25 GB, copy the backup file locally with a utility, such as AzCopy, and perform the restore from the local copy

    - If the log is very large in size (multiple gigabytes), it would be expected that restore would be slow. During restore, the log file must be zeroed, which takes a significant amount of time.

## Checklist of preferred objection handling

1. Solution must support orchestrated failover so that failover does not require all hands-on deck.

    **Potential answer**

    Azure Site Recovery orchestrates replication of your on-premises and virtual machines to a secondary on-premises data center or to Azure. Site recovery handles the VM replication and integrates with SQL Server Always On availability groups. Failover can be kicked off with a simple click.

2. Solution must support the existing VMware infrastructure.

    **Potential answer**

    Azure Site Recovery supports the replication of on-premises servers, Azure virtual machines, Hyper-V virtual machines, and VMware virtual machines.

3. Solution must not have a significant impact on database performance.

    **Potential answer**

    The use of asynchronous replicas to the disaster recovery site will keep the overhead of Availability Group replication to near zero, while providing the application the ability to offload the heavier read workloads to the secondary replicas.

4. Disaster recovery infrastructure must be easily scalable to support changes in the workload.

    **Potential answer**

    As workloads change, Azure virtual machines can be scaled up or down as necessary to provide the appropriate amount of resources. This can be done by modifying the virtual machine size.

5. The disaster recovery sites must be highly available after a failover.

    **Potential answer**

    By placing Azure virtual machines into an Availability Set, you can keep your virtual machines available during downtime such as during maintenance or unplanned outages. It is best practice to use availability sets and load-balancing endpoints to help ensure that your application is always available and running efficiently.

    SQL Server virtual machines will rely on a combination of Availability Sets and SQL Server Always On availability groups to maintain uptime and synchronization. The SQL Servers will belong to a separate Availability Set from the web servers and will also use an internal load balancer.

6. We have seen some documentation surrounding the use of Availability Zones in Azure. What does Availability Zones provide over and above Availability Sets? Would this be a good option for us?

    **Potential answer**

    Availability Zones would be suitable for Fabrikamâs solution providing that Availability Zones are available in your preferred region. Availability Zones provide you with added protection by separating resources across multiple local datacenters within a given region with separate networking, storage, power etc. However, the datacenters are still close enough to allow for synchronous replication between servers. Availability Zones also provide slightly higher SLAs for availability at 99.99% compared to 99.95% for Availability Sets.

7. Archive solution must not impact the current applications, which periodically pull historical data from the production system.

    **Potential answer**

    SQL Server Stretch Database does not require any changes to existing queries or applications; the location of the data is completely transparent to the application. The entire table is always online and can be queried. You will set the policy that determines where the data is stored, either on the local server or in Azure.

8. Backups need to be secured offsite in less than two hours after completion.

    **Potential answer**

    Azure Backup backs up to an Azure Recovery Services Vault. As soon as the backup is complete, it is offsite and protected. Furthermore, if using geo-redundant storage for the Recovery Services Vault, your database backups will be asynchronously replicated to a secondary region hundreds of miles away.
