# SQL Server hybrid cloud whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this whiteboard design session, you will look at how to design an application for hybrid deployment between on-premises and Microsoft Azure. You will consider how the web tier must be made available in the event of an outage as well as how to configure SQL Server Always-on Availability Groups to deploy and failover between both locations.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design a hybrid disaster recovery solution between an on-premises VMWare environment and Azure. In addition, you will design a SQL Server scale-out solution, protect database backups from local failures, archive cold data from an on-premises SQL Server, and perform end-to-end encryption on sensitive application data.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions:  With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1. Meet your table participants and trainer.

2. Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3. As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Fabrikam Publishing is a media and publishing company in Seattle, Washington with approximately 5000 employees. They have a successful direct-to-consumer e-commerce site built with .NET, and they use SQL Server to store customer profile and order information.
Fabrikam has a single data center for both internal and customer-facing applications. Most servers are virtualized on VMware. Application servers primarily run Microsoft server software, including Active Directory (AD) Domain Services and a number of AD-integrated services including Exchange 2013 as well as multi-tier, internal, and AD-integrated Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) based web applications with SQL Server 2017 as the database platform.

Recently, the site experienced a multi-day outage due to a lightning strike that disabled both the primary and secondary cooling systems at the data center. In order to avoid such long outages in the future, Fabrikam is investing in a secondary site for disaster recovery. "A disaster recovery site has been on our project proposals for the last four years, but it has always been shelved due to budget constraints," says Michelle Jenkins, Chief Information Officer (CIO). "The recent outage combined with the new capabilities in the cloud have finally encouraged the board to approve the additional budget necessary to build out our disaster recover (DR) capabilities." To keep capital expenditures in check, Fabrikam would like to use the public cloud to host its DR site.

James Sherburn, Director of Information Technology Operations, describes Fabrikam's current disaster recovery strategy as a classic backup/restore strategy with no offsite warm standby machines. Backups are dumped on a network share, and these backups are then archived once per day to an offsite location. There is no enterprise backup solution in place. According to Sherburn, this strategy requires an "all hands-on deck" approach to recovering the site, which is resource-intensive and slow. It also requires significant expense to bring temporary hardware online at a remote, vendor-provided data center. Because of the cost and complexity, this disaster recovery plan has never been tested, and Information Technology (IT) is not confident that it could bring up the secondary site in a reasonable amount of time. This lack of confidence in the current DR strategy prevented IT management from implementing a failover during the last disaster, resulting in significant losses for the company.

The application team is concerned that the database DR solution will have a negative impact on the overall database performance. The website currently experiences periodic database latency issues during peak load. They would like to have a solution that improves performance of the predominantly read workloads generated by the website to improve the overall responsiveness and the user experience. The Database Architect, Brandon Burns, saw a presentation at a conference last year on leveraging SQL Server Always On availability groups with readable secondaries to offload read workloads. Brandon said, "Our ideal solution would be a scale out solution for the data platform, however, we are concerned about potentially making a lot of application code changes." We need a solution that minimizes the amount of changes in the application, and we would like to investigate SQL Server Always On availability groups and readable secondaries.

The database administration team is worried about future Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance issues related to data that is currently stored in varchar fields in the database. In the current system, the database is inaccessible from outside the application except through a dedicated administrative jump-box. Implementing a DR site means that we will be transferring data, and they want to make sure that PCI data being transferred is encrypted. They are concerned about cloud security and the implications it may have to their annual PCI audits. To mitigate any perceived risk and shortcut any issues that may be raised in the PCI audit, they would like to encrypt ALL of the PCI data at both the application and database level.

Future application plans call for new applications that will need to access the encrypted PCI/PII data stored in the database. Key management should be handled by the Fabrikam Security Administration team. They will be responsible for protecting and managing the keys. They need a solution that enables them to accomplish this goal across the multiple applications that will potentially leverage the encrypted database without revealing unencrypted production keys to DBAs or developers.

An additional concern is that the database maintenance jobs are exceeding the current maintenance window. Robert Moore, Manager of Database Administration, believes this is due to the lack of an archive strategy on the current order related tables. Backup times have gradually increased over time to the point where they exceed the maintenance window. Moore's other concern is the sheer size of these databases could make initial synchronization or resynchronization of the DR site a long process that could result in the site running in an exposed state for extended periods. Currently, the database holds approximately 10 years' worth of data. "Data older than one year is rarely accessed," says Moore. The business has resisted any data archiving because of several reports that periodically need access to the historical data.

Finally, Fabrikam has a requirement to store the database backups offsite in an encrypted format within two hours of backup completion and they need insight into when backups are not occurring across all databases in the environment, they currently rely on manual configuration of SQL Agent jobs to run backups and management is concerned that not all databases are being backed up appropriately. The current backup strategy consists of SQL Server backups to an on-premises file server; the backups are then copied to tape and shipped offsite. This process can take up to 24 hours to secure the tapes offsite. In addition to being slow, the tape backups are notoriously unreliable and are generally not available for ad hoc access in the case that a restore becomes necessary. Fabrikam would like to have these backups secured offsite within two hours of the backup completing and a centralized backup management and monitoring solution.

### Customer needs 

1. A full multi-site disaster recovery solution with minimal complexity, orchestrated failover, and near-zero data loss.

2. Highly available, fault-tolerant SQL Server service with cross-site disaster recovery and minimal impact on database performance.

3. Scale-out the data platform utilizing SQL Server Always On availability groups with readable secondaries to offload the heavy read workloads from the primary replica with minimal changes to the application.

4. The ability to seamlessly scale DR site infrastructure as the environment grows.

5. Data encryption solution that encrypts only PCI data at the application and database level.

6. Key management solution that does not expose the unencrypted keys to unauthorized personnel (including database administrators and developers) and allows for key management by the security administration team.

7. Data archiving to keep database sizes more manageable and reduce the amount of time needed for database maintenance.

8. Centralized management and monitoring of backups with secure offsite backups.

### Customer objections

1. Solution must support orchestrated failover so that failover does not require an all hands-on deck.

2. Solution must support the existing VMware infrastructure.

3. Solution must not have a significant impact on database performance.

4. DR infrastructure must be easily scalable to support changes in the workload.

5. The disaster recovery sites must be highly available after a failover.

6. We have seen some documentation surrounding the use of Availability Zones in Azure. What does Availability Zones provide over and above Availability Sets? Would this be a good option for us?

7. Archive solution must not impact the current applications that periodically pull historical data from the production system.

8. We need to be able to backup databases both on-premises and in the cloud. How will your backup solution support this?

### Infographic for common scenarios

#### Azure Site Recovery

![This is a screenshot of a slide. Common scenarios for Azure Site Recovery include the following bulleted list items: ??? Support for on-premises to on-premises, and on-premises to Azure failover ??? Automated protection and replication of on-premises, Hyper-V, and VMware machines ??? Orchestrated failover ??? Customizable recovery plans ??? Recovery plan testing To the right of the list is a diagram of the multiple deployment architectures of Azure Site Recover: on-premises datacenter to Azure, and on-premises datacenter to on-premises datacenter. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the diagram. Future versions of this course should address this.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-SQLServerhybridcloudimages/media/image3.png "Common Azure Site Recovery scenarios")

#### Azure Traffic Manager
