# Exercise 8: Performance testing of web app (Optional)

### Estimated Duration: 30 minutes

Azure Load Testing Preview is a fully managed load-testing service that enables you to generate a high-scale load. Regardless of where your applications are hosted, the service simulates traffic for them. It can be used by programmers, testers, and quality assurance (QA) engineers to enhance the speed, scalability, or capacity of applications.

Azure Load Testing is currently in preview because of this we have limited options available as of now.

### Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
   - Task 1: Performance testing of web app (Optional)
