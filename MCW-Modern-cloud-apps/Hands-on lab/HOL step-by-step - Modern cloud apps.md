# Modern cloud apps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Azure App Services, Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Azure Logic Apps, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure.

Please note that as opposed to the Whiteboard Design Session, the lab is not focused on maintaining PCI compliance and using more advanced security features such as App Service Environment, Network Security Groups, and Application Gateway. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

By the end of this hands-on lab, you will have learned how to use several key services within Azure to improve overall functionality of the original solution, and to increase the security and scalability of the new and improved design.

## Overview

The Contoso Sports League Association (CSLA) is one of the largest sports franchises and is struggling to keep up with demand from their growing user base. They currently host an e-commerce website and have a backend website that supports their call center, allowing employees to view order information.

CSLA would like to modernize their websites and move to the cloud, ultimately moving away from managing infrastructure. They are interested in whether Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) will meet their needs so they can completely remove the infrastructure management overhead. However, they are concerned about securing their websites and data to meet the stringent PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliance requirements.

## Solution architecture

![A diagram that depicts the various Azure PaaS services for the solution. Azure AD Org is used for authentication to the call center app. Azure AD B2C for authentication is used for authentication to the client app. SQL Database for the backend customer data. Azure App Services for the web and API apps. Order processing includes using Functions, Logic Apps, Queues and Storage. Azure App Insights is used for telemetry capture.](media/image2.png "Solution Architecture Diagram")

## Exercise 1: Create Key Vault secrets and add to App Configuration

**Duration**: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you retrieve various keys and connection string from resources in the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group and use them to create secrets in Key Vault. You will first copy connection string and keys into a text editor, such as Notepad.exe, for easier reference when creating secrets in Key Vault. You finish the exercise by adding references to the Key Vault into the App Configuration resource.

### Task 1: Retrieve database connection string

In this task, you retrieve the connection string for the ContosoSports DB SQL Database, set the password, and save it to a text editor, such as Notepad.exe.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. Select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group from the list.

   ![The "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX" resource group is highlighted.](./media/resource-groups.png "Resource groups list")

3. In the list of resources within your resource group, select the **ContosoSportsDB** SQL database resource.

   ![The list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group are displayed, and ContosoSportsDB is highlighted.](./media/resource-group-resources-sql-db.png "ContosoSportsDB in resource group list")

4. On the **SQL Database** blade, select the **Show database connection strings** link within the Essentials area.

    ![On the SQL Database blade, in the left pane, Overview is selected. In the right pane, under Essentials, the Connection strings (Show database connection strings) link is circled.](media/sql-db-connection-strings-link.png "SQL Database blade")

5. On the **Connection strings** blade, select the **Copy to clipboard** icon in the bottom right-hand corner of the `ADO.NET` connection string box.

    ![In the Database connection strings blade, the ADO.NET connection string is circled.](media/sql-db-connection-string-ado-net.png "Database connection strings blade")

6. Paste the copied connection string into a text editor, such as **Notepad.exe** and then replace the `{your_password}` token with `Password.1!!`.

7. In the tasks below, you will be copying additional values into the text editor, so you can have easy access to these values for creating secrets in Key Vault later in this hand-on lab. Leave the text editor open.

### Task 2: Retrieve Storage Account access key

In this task, you retrieve the access key for your Azure Storage account and save it to a text editor, such as Notepad.exe.

1. Return to the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group and select the **contoso** Storage account resource from the list.

    ![The storage account resource is highlighted in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/resource-group-resources-storage-account.png "Storage account resource")

2. On the **Storage account** blade, select the **Access keys** in the left-hand navigation menu, and on the **Access keys** blade, from the top toolbar, select the **Show keys** button (text will change to **Hide keys**) and then copy the **key1** **Connection string** value by selecting the **Copy to clipboard** icon.

    ![The Access keys blade is displayed, with Access keys highlighted in the left-hand menu and the copy to clipboard icon highlighted next to the key1 Connection string value.](media/storage-account-access-keys.png "Storage account access keys")

3. Paste the copied value into your open text editor for later reference, as you did with the database connection string above.

### Task 3: Retrieve Service Bus Queue connection string

In this task, you retrieve the primary connection string for the `receiptgenerator` Service Bus queue and save it to a text editor, such as Notepad.exe.

1. Return to the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group and select the **Service Bus Namespace** resource from the list.

    ![The Service Bus Namespace resource is highlighted in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/resource-group-resources-service-bus-namespace.png "Service Bus Namespace resource")

2. On the Service Bus Namespace blade, select **Queues** from the left-hand navigation menu, under the Entities header, and then select the `receiptgenerator` queue.

    ![On the Queues blade, the Queues item is highlighted in the left-hand menu and the receiptgenerator queue is highlighted.](media/service-bus-queues-receipt-generator.png "Queues")

3. On the `receiptgenerator` Service Bus Queue blade, select **Shared access policies** in the left-hand navigation menu and then select the **Publisher** policy.

    ![On the Shared access policies blade, Shared access policies in highlighted in the left-hand navigation menu and the Publisher policy is highlighted in the list of policies.](media/service-bus-queues-shared-access-policies.png "Shared access policies")

    >**Note**: The _Publisher_ and _Listener_ shared access policies for the Azure Service Bus Queue were deployed as part of the ARM Template that was used to setup the lab environment. Notice the **Publisher** policy only has permissions to _Send_ messages to the queue.
    >
    > By default, no policies are created. Additionally, it is best practice to use least privilege security to create separate shared access policies for publishers sending messages and listeners receiving messages from the queue.

4. On the **SAS Policy: Publisher** dialog, copy the **Primary Connection String** by selecting the **Copy to clipboard** icon.

    ![The copy to clipboard icon is highlighted next to the primary connection string on the SAS Policy: Publisher dialog.](media/service-bus-queues-sas-policy-publisher.png "SAS Policy: Publisher")

5. Paste the copied value into your open text editor for later reference, as you did with the database connection string above.

### Task 4: Create secrets in Azure Key Vault

In this task, you create secrets in Key Vault for each of the connection strings and keys you retrieved in the tasks above.

1. Return to the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group and select the **Key vault** resource from the list.

    ![The Key Vault resource is highlighted in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/resource-group-resources-key-vault.png "Key Vault resource")

2. Select **Secrets** from the left-hand navigation menu and then select **Generate/Import**.

    ![The Secrets item in highlighted in the left-hand menu and Generate/Import is highlighted on the Secrets blade.](media/key-vault-secrets.png "Key Vault Secrets")

3. You will create three secrets in Key Vault, using the values you copied into your text editor. The secrets will be named according to the table below:

    | Name | Value |
    |------|-------|
    | AzureQueueConnectionString | Use the primary connection string you recorded for the Service Bus `receiptgenerator` queue |
    | ContosoSportsLeague | Use the database connection string |
    | contososportsstorage | Use the storage account connection string you recorded for the storage account |

4. On the **Create a secret** blade, enter the following:

    - **Name**: Enter `AzureQueueConnectionString`.
    - **Value**: Paste the Service Bus queue primary connection string value into this box.

    > The remaining settings will retain their default values.

    ![The Create a secret form is displayed with the Name and Value fields highlighted.](media/key-vault-create-a-secret.png "Create a secret")

5. Select **Create**.

6. Select **Generate/Import** again and repeat steps 4 and 5 for the remaining two secrets specified in the table above, replacing the name and value settings with appropriate values.

7. You should end up with three secrets in Key Vault.

    ![The list of newly created secrets in Key Vault is displayed.](media/key-vault-secrets-list.png "Key Vault secrets")

    ![The new version button is highlighted on the toolbar of the secret version blade.](media/key-vault-secret-new-version.png "New secret version")

4. Copy the original connection string to the **ContosoSportsDB**, but replace the server name with the **Azure SQL Failover Group Read/Write Listener Endpoint** that was copied previously, then select **Create**. The new version of the connection string should look similar to the following:

    ```sh
    Server=tcp:{failover_group_endpoint},1433;Initial Catalog=ContosoSportsDB;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=demouser;Password=Password.1!!;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;
    ```

    ![The ContosoSportsLeague secret Versions screen is shown with a current and older version present in the list. ](media/new-secret-version.png "Secrets version list")

### Task 5: Failover SQL Database Failover Group

### Task 6: Modify the Contoso.App.SportsLeague.Web

1. In Visual Studio, expand the **Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web** project within the Solution Explorer. then locate and open the `Startup.cs` code file.

2. Add the following `using` directives to the top of the `Startup.cs` code file:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI;
    ```

3. Locate the `public void ConfigureServices` method declaration and add the following line of code to the bottom of this method:

    ```csharp
    services.AddAuthentication(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI.AzureADB2CDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                .AddAzureADB2C(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureADB2C", options));
    ```

    ![The Startup.cs file with the "app.UseAuthorization();" line of code highlighted.](media/2019-04-19-15-08-40.png "Startup.cs")

4. Locate the `app.UseAuthorization();` line within the `public void Configure` method, and add the following line of code before it:

    ```csharp
    app.UseAuthentication();
    ```

    The result will look similar to the following:

    ![app.UseAuthentication code inserted.](media/2020-03-18-14-44-13.png "app.UseAuthentication code inserted")

5. Select **Save** on the toolbar to save the `Startup.cs` file.

### Task 7: Send authentication requests to Azure AD

Your app is now configured to communicate with Azure AD B2C by using ASP.NET Core Identity. OWIN has taken care of all the details of crafting authentication messages, validating tokens from Azure AD, and maintaining user session. All that remains is to initiate each user's flow.

1. Right select the **Controllers** folder and select **Add** -> **Controller**.

    ![In Solution Explorer, in the right-click menu for the Controllers folder, Add is selected, and from its menu, Controller is selected.](media/image177.png "Solution Explorer")

2. Select **MVC Controller - Empty** and then select **Add**. Replace default name of **HomeController1.cs** with the name of **AccountController.cs** for the new Controller being added.

    ![On the left of the Add Scaffold window, Installed / Controller is selected. In the center of the window, MVC 5 Controller - Empty is selected.](media/image178.png "Add Scaffold window")

3. Add the following using statements to the top of the controller, below the existing using statements:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    ```

4. Locate the default controller **Index** method.

    ![The Default controller method Index is circled.](media/image179.png "Default controller method Index")

5. Replace the method with the following code:

    ```csharp
    private string _editProfilePolicyId;

    public AccountController(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _editProfilePolicyId = configuration.GetValue<string>("AzureADB2C:EditProfilePolicyId");
    }

    public ActionResult SignIn()
    {
        if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" }, AzureADB2CDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
        }
        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    }

    public ActionResult SignUp()
    {
        if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" }, AzureADB2CDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
        }
        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    }

    public ActionResult Profile()
    {
        if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
                var properties = new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" };
                properties.Items[AzureADB2CDefaults.PolicyKey] = _editProfilePolicyId;
                return Challenge(
                    properties,
                    AzureADB2CDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
        }
        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    }

    public ActionResult SignOut()
    {
        if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }
        string redirectUri = Url.Action("Index", "Home", null, Request.Scheme);
        var properties = new AuthenticationProperties
        {
            RedirectUri = redirectUri
        };
        return SignOut(properties, AzureADB2CDefaults.CookieScheme, AzureADB2CDefaults.OpenIdScheme);
    }
    ```

6. Save the file by selecting **Save** on the Visual Studio toolbar.

### Task 8: Display user information

When you authenticate users by using OpenID Connect, Azure AD returns an ID token to the app that contains **claims**. These are assertions about the user. You can use claims to personalize your app. You can access user claims in your controllers via the ClaimsPrincipal.Current security principal object.

1. Open the **Controllers\\HomeController.cs** file and add the following using statements at the end of the other using statements at the top of the file, below the existing using statements:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
    ```

2. Next, add the following method to the **HomeController** class:

    ```csharp
    [Authorize]
    public ActionResult Claims()
    {
        var displayName = User.Identity.Name;
        ViewBag.DisplayName = displayName;
        ViewBag.Claims = User.Claims;
        return View();
    }
    ```

3. To access the claims that your application receives, you will create a new claims view that will display a list of all the claims the app receives. In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer, expand the **Views -\> Home** folder under the **Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web** project, right-click the **Home** folder, and then select **Add -\> View**.

    ![In Solution Explorer, on the right-click menu for Views\\Home, Add is selected, and from its menu, View is selected.](media/views-home-add-view.png "Solution Explorer")

4. On the **Add New Scaffolded Item** dialog, select **Razor View - Empty** and select **Add**.

    ![On the Add New Scaffolded Item dialog, Razor View - Empty is selected and highlighted.](media/add-new-scaffolded-item-razor-view-empty.png "Add New Scaffolded Item")

5. On the **Add New Item** dialog, enter **Claims.cshtml** as the name of the new view and then select **Add**.

    ![On the Add New Item dialog, Claims.cshtml is entered in to the name field and the Add button is highlighted.](media/add-new-item-claims.png "Add new item")

6. In the new **Claims.cshtml** file that opens in Visual Studio, replace all the file's contents with the following code:

    ```csharp
    @using System.Security.Claims
    @{
        ViewBag.Title = "Claims";
    }
    <h2>@ViewBag.Title</h2>

    <h4>Claims Present in the Claims Identity: @ViewBag.DisplayName</h4>

    <table class="table-hover claim-table">
        <tr>
            <th class="claim-type claim-data claim-head">Claim Type</th>
            <th class="claim-data claim-head">Claim Value</th>
        </tr>

        @foreach (Claim claim in ViewBag.Claims)
        {
            <tr>
                <td class="claim-type claim-data">@claim.Type</td>
                <td class="claim-data">@claim.Value</td>
            </tr>
        }
    </table>
    ```

7. Select **Save** on the toolbar in Visual Studio to save the `Claims.cshtml` file.

8. Next, you will create a partial view to handle logging users in and out under the **Shared** folder. Right-click on the **Views -\> Shared** folder, select **Add**, add a new **View**.

9. On the **Add New Scaffolded Item** dialog, select **Razor View - Empty** and select **Add**.

10. On the **Add New Item** dialog, enter **\_LoginPartial.cshtml** for the name (making sure to include the leading underscore, "_", in the file name) and then select **Add**.

11. Replace all contents of the file with the following code to create a razor partial view to provide a sign-in and sign-out link as well as a link to edit the user's profile:

    ```html
    @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        <text>
            <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
                <li>
                    <a id="profile-link">@User.Identity.Name</a>
                    <div id="profile-options" class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
                        <ul class="profile-links">
                            <li class="profile-link">
                                @Html.ActionLink("Edit Profile", "Profile", "Account")
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    @Html.ActionLink("Sign out", "SignOut", "Account")
                </li>
            </ul>
        </text>
    }
    else
    {
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
            <li>@Html.ActionLink("Sign up", "SignUp", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "signUpLink" })</li>
            <li>@Html.ActionLink("Sign in", "SignIn", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "loginLink" })</li>
        </ul>
    }
    ```

12. Select **Save** on the toolbar in Visual Studio to save the `_LoginPartial.cshtml` file.

13. Open `Views\Shared\_Layout.cshtml` in Visual Studio.

14. Locate the **DIV** markdown element that has the class of `header-top` (line 46 of the file), and add the line that starts with `@Html.ActionLink` and the line that starts with `@Html.Partial`.

    ```html
    <div class="header-top">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="header-top-left">

## Exercise 12: Automate deployments using GitHub actions

Duration: 30 minutes

The Contoso Sports League would like to move their existing source control to GitHub. In addition to this, they wish to implement automatic deployments of their projects into production. The desired workflow is that features are developed in their own branch and once complete, pull requests are issued to the main branch. The pull requests are then reviewed for quality assurance, and once approved, the pull request is then merged into the main branch of the repository. Upon this merge, the projects in the solution should be automatically released into the production Azure environment using the code from the main branch. In this exercise, you will learn how to deploy code to Azure from GitHub Actions in two different ways: via a Service Principal created in Active Directory, as well as via Application Service Publish Profiles.

### Task 1: Create a GitHub repository

1. Open a web browser and navigate to <https://www.github.com>. Log in using your GitHub account credentials.

2. In the upper-right corner, expand the user drop down menu and select **Your repositories**.

    ![The user menu is expanded with the Your repositories item selected.](media/github_yourrepositoriesmenu.png "GitHub user menu")

3. Next to the search criteria, locate and select the **New** button.

    ![The GitHub Find a repository search criteria is shown with the New button selected.](media/github_newbutton.png "New repository button")

4. On the **Create a new repository** screen, name the repository **ContosoSports** and select the **Create repository** button.

    ![The Create a new repository screen is shown with the Repository name set to ContosoSports and the Create repository button is highlighted.](media/github_createrepositoryform.png "Create a new repository form")

5. On the **Quick setup** screen, copy the **HTTPS** GitHub URL for your new repository, paste this in notepad for future use.

    ![The Quick setup screen is displayed with the copy button next to the GitHub URL textbox selected.](media/github_copygithuburl.png "The quick setup screen")

### Task 2: Commit the existing lab files to source control

1. Open a command prompt and change directory to the folder that contains the lab files solution file (Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.sln), `C:\MCW\MCW-Modern-cloud-apps-main\Hands-on lab\lab-files\src\Contoso Sports League`.

2. At the command prompt, issue the following command to initialize the git repository:

    ```shell
    git init
    ```

3. Set the remote origin to the GitHub Url from the previous task by executing the following command (replace the URL with your own):

   ```shell
   git remote add origin <your GitHub Url>
   ```

4. Commit the initial code, and push it to the main branch by issuing the following commands:

    ```shell
    git config --global user.email "<ENTER YOUR GITHUB EMAIL HERE>"
    git add -A
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git branch -m main
    git push -u origin main
    ```

### Task 3: Create a service principal in Active Directory

One method to deploy code using GitHub actions is to create a Service Principal that has the necessary access to deploy the web applications in the solution. In this exercise, we will be releasing the Call Center Admin Portal application using this service principal. This service principal is created in Azure Active Directory, and is granted the Contributor role to the deployed lab resources, scoped by the resource group.

1. In the Azure portal, select the icon to open the Cloud Shell located on the top toolbar.

    ![A portion of the Azure Portal top toolbar is displayed with the Cloud Shell menu item highlighted.](media/azureportal_cloudshellmenuitem.png "The cloud shell taskbar item")

    > **Note**: You may be prompted to create a storage account to support cloud shell activities, this is required in order to utilize the cloud shell.

2. Obtain the Subscription ID and Resource Group name by opening the resource group where you have deployed all the applications in this lab. The Subscription ID is available in the Overview pane.

3. In the Cloud Shell, execute the following to create the service principal scoped by the resource group we've been using in this lab (replace Subscription ID and resource group name):

    ```PowerShell
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name 'mcw-modern-cloud-apps' --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<Subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<Resource Group Name> --sdk-auth
    ```

4. This will output a JSON data result, copy and paste this result and save it for a future step in this lab.

    ![The output of the previous command is displayed with the JSON result highlighted.](media/azurecloudshell_serviceprincipaljson.png "JSON output in the cloud shell")

### Task 4: Create repository secrets

You have the ability to add secrets to the repository in GitHub. Secrets contain sensitive information that should never be checked into source control. These secrets are kept encrypted by GitHub and are made available to GitHub actions through the **secrets** collection (which you will see in the next task). We will be creating many secrets, as we have five projects that we are configuring for auto-deployment.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subtask 1: Create the service principal credentials secret

1. In GitHub, return to the **ContosoSports** repository screen and select the **Settings** tab.

2. From the left menu, select **Secrets**.

3. Select the **New secret** button.

   ![The Settings tab of the ContosoSports repository is shown with the Secrets menu item and the New secret button highlighted.](media/github_newsecretbutton.png "GitHub repository settings")

4. In the New secret form, enter the name **AZURE_CREDENTIALS**, and for the value, paste in the JSON data obtained when creating the Service Principal in the previous task. Select **Add secret**.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subtask 2: Create the e-commerce web application publish profile secret

1. In the Azure Portal, open the e-commerce web application service, it is the one named contosoapp{randomcharacters}.

2. From the top toolbar of the App Service screen, select **Get publish profile** item. This will download a file. Open this file in a text editor.

    ![On the App service screen, the Get publish profile button is highlighted on the toolbar menu.](media/azureportal_appservice_getpublishprofile.png "Get Publish profile")

3. Return to the ContosoSports repository GitHub Secrets screen, and add a new secret named **AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE**, for the value, paste the contents of the publish profile from the previous step, then select the **Add secret** button.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subtask 3: Create publish profile secrets for the remaining projects

Repeat Subtask 2 for the remaining projects by obtaining the publish profiles from the Azure Portal. Create the secrets as follows:

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| AZURE_API_PAYMENT_PUBLISH_PROFILE | Contents of the publish profile for the Payments API |
| AZURE_API_OFFERS_PUBLISH_PROFILE | Contents of the publish profile for the Offers API |
| AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE | Contents of the publish profile for the Receipt Function Application |

![The GitHub repository secrets screen is displayed with a table containing all the secrets added in this lab.](media/github_secretslisting.png "GitHub repository secrets")

### Task 5: Define the production deployment workflow

1. In the web browser, return to the ContosoSports repository on GitHub, and select the **Actions** tab.

    ![On the ContosoSports repository screen, the Actions tab is selected.](media/github_actionstab.png "Repository Actions")

2. Beneath the **Get started with GitHub Actions** heading, select the **set up a workflow yourself** link.

3. Above the editor, name the workflow **productiondeployment.yml**. Remove all code in the file editor.

    ![The Actions workflow editor is displayed with an empty code listing with the name productiondeployment.yml highlighted.](media/github_actions_namedandempty.png "The Actions workflow editor")

4. Copy and paste the following workflow to the text editor. The code is documented inline.

    ```yml
    name: Contoso Sports Production Deployment

    # This workflow is triggered on push to the main branch of the repository

    >**Note**: Due to the nature of some browsers, you may need to adjust the whitespace of the yml document after it has been pasted into GitHub.

5. Select the **Start commit** button to commit the workflow to the repository.

6. Enter a commit title and comment, and select **Commit new file**.

    ![The Commit new file dialog is shown with the title and description populated.](media/github_commitworkflowform.png "Commit new file dialog")

7. Committing this file is a push to the main branch. This means that the workflow that we just created is triggered. Select the **Actions** tab to view the currently running/historical record of workflow executions.

    ![The workflow we just defined is triggered and is displayed on the Actions tab.](media/github_workflowsstatus.png "GitHub repository Actions tab")

8. You are able to drill into each workflow, and each job executed by the workflow. Furthermore, as you drill into the job, you are able to see the output of each step contained in the job by expanding the section in the console runner window.

    ![The workflow is currently running, the workflow run displays the current status each job.](media/github_runningworkflowsteps.png "Running workflow")

    ![A completed workflow job console is shown with one of the steps expanded so that the output of the step is displayed.](media/github_jobstepexpanded.png "Completed workflow")

### Task 6: Trigger the Production Deployment Workflow

In this task, we will be making a modification to the e-commerce web application in a branch and issuing a pull request to the main branch. We will manually merge the pull request into the main branch to trigger the production deployment workflow.

1. Open a command prompt, and change directory to where the Visual Studio solution file is found.

2. Execute the following commands to create a branch for this modification. Keep this command window open.

    ```shell
    git pull
    git branch textchange
    git checkout textchange
    ```

3. In Visual Studio, expand the e-commerce website project (Web/Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web), and edit and save the **Views/Home/Index.cshtml** file.

    ![The code listing for Views/Home/Index.cshtml is shown with some modified text highlighted.](media/visualstudio_edithomeindex.png "Visual Studio file editor")

4. Return to the command window and execute the following commands to commit the text change to the branch:

    ```shell
    git commit -am "Changed some text"
    git push --set-upstream origin textchange
    ```

5. In a web browser, return to the ContosoSports source code repository.

6. Above the file listing table, you should see a notification that **textchange had recent pushes**. Select the **Compare &amp; pull request** button.

    ![The textchange had recent pushes notification is shown with the Compare and pull request button highlighted.](media/github_compareandpullrequest.png "Recent push notification")

7. On the **Open a pull request** form, feel free to write a comment, and select the **Create pull request** button.

8. You should now see a message indicating that there are no conflicts with the base branch.

    ![A message indicating there are no conflicts is shown.](media/github_pullrequest_noconflicts.png "No conflicts on the branch")

9. Select the **Actions** tab of the repository to verify that the deployment workflow has not been triggered by the recent file commits on the textchange branch.

10. Return to the pull request that was just created, by selecting the **Pull requests** tab, and selecting the pull request in the list.

11. Select the **Merge pull request** button on the pull request, then select **Confirm merge**.

12. Return to the **Actions** tab, and you should see that the workflow has been triggered (merging pushes new code to the branch, thus the production workflow is triggered).

    ![The workflows list is displayed with an in progress workflow that has been triggered by the merge of the pull request.](media/github_mergeworkflowtriggered.png "Workflow in progress")

13. Once the deployment workflow has completed. Navigate to the E-commerce web application and ensure the changes you made are visible.

    ![A portion of the e-commerce website is shown with the textual change highlighted.](media/ecommerce_textchangevisible.png "Screenshot demonstrating the text change")

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

### Task 1: Delete resources

1. Since the HOL is now complete, go ahead and delete all the Resource Groups that were created for this HOL. You will no longer need those resources and it will be beneficial to clean up your Azure Subscription.

2. In GitHub, open the ContosoSports repository and select **Settings**. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and select the **Delete this repository** button in the **Danger Zone** section.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the hands-on lab.
