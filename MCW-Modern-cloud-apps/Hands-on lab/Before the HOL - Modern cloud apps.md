# Modern cloud apps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure MSDN subscription
- You must have permissions within your Azure Subscription and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to create users and setup Azure AD B2C.

## Before the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all steps provided _before_ attending the hands-on lab.

> **Important**: Many Azure resources require globally unique names. Throughout these steps, `XXXXX` appears as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure uniquely named resources.

### Task 1: Create a resource group

In this task, you create an Azure resource group to serve as a container for the resources you will use throughout this hands-on lab.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. On the Resource groups blade, select **Create**.

   ![Create is highlighted in the toolbar on Resource groups blade.](media/resource-groups-add.png "Resource groups")

3. On the Create a resource group **Basics** tab, enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource group**: Enter `hands-on-lab-XXXXX` as the name of the new resource group, where `XXXXX` is a unique suffix, such as your initials or a random number used to ensure a unique resource group name.
   - **Region**: Select the region you are using for this hands-on lab.

   ![The values specified above are entered into the Create a resource group Basics tab.](media/create-resource-group.png "Create resource group")

4. Select **Review + Create**.

5. On the **Review + create** tab, ensure the Validation passed message is displayed and then select **Create**.

### Task 2: Run ARM template to provision lab resources

In this task, you run an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to create the hands-on lab's resources. In addition to creating resources, the ARM template also executes a PowerShell script on the `LabVM` to install software and configure the server. The resources created by the ARM template include:

- [Azure App Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview)
- [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview)
- [Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview)
- [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview)
- [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview)
- [App Service Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans)
- [Web App](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview)
- [Azure Storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview)
- [Service Bus namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview)
- [Virtual network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) with `default` subnet
- [Virtual machine using the Visual Studio 2019 (Latest) Community Edition image](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/using-visual-studio-vm)
  - Uses custom script extension to
    - Disable **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**
    - Download starter solution from Serverless architecture MCW GitHub repo
    - Download and install Azure Data Studio
    - Download and install Microsoft Edge browser
- [Network security group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) for VM
- [Network interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface) for VM
- [Public IP address](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/public-ip-addresses) for VM

1. Select the following **Deploy to Azure** button to deploy the ARM Template with the Lab VM resources for this lab. This link will deep link into the Azure Portal, passing in the ARM Template for deploying the resources for this lab.

    <a href ="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FMCW-Modern-cloud-apps%2Fmain%2FHands-on%20lab%2Flab-files%2Farm-template%2Fazure-deploy.json" target="_blank" title="Deploy to Azure">
        <img src="https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
    </a>

2. On the custom deployment screen, the first parameter you need to populate is the `ObjectId` associated with the account you used to log into the Azure portal. To retrieve this, select the **Cloud Shell** icon on the Azure portal toolbar to open an Azure command line interface (CLI) terminal window at the bottom of your open browser window.

   ![The Cloud Shell icon is highlighted on the Azure portal toolbar.](media/azure-toolbar-cloud-shell.png "Azure toolbar")

3. In the PowerShell terminal window that opens in the Azure portal, enter the following command at the prompt:

   ```powershell
   az ad signed-in-user show --query objectId -o tsv
   ```

   ![At the cloud shell prompt, the az ad signed-in-user show command is entered and highlighted.](media/azure-cli-az-ad-signed-in-user-show.png "Azure CLI")

4. Execute the command and copy the output value.

   ![In the cloud shell, the output from the az ad signed-in-user show command is highlighted.](media/azure-cli-az-ad-signed-in-user-show-output.png "Azure CLI")

5. Now, on the custom deployment screen in the Azure portal, enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource group**: Select the hands-on-lab-XXXXXX resource group from the dropdown list.
   - **Signed In User Object Id**: Paste the value you copied above from the cloud shell terminal command output.
   - **Username**: Accept the default value, **demouser**.
   - **Password**: Accept the default value, **Password.1!!**.

   ![The Custom deployment blade is displayed, and the information above is entered on the Custom deployment blade.](media/azure-custom-deployment.png "Custom deployment blade")

6. Select **Review + create** to review the custom deployment.

   > **Note**: The ARM template will append a hyphen followed by a 13-digit string at the end of resource names. This suffix ensures globally unique names for resources. We will ignore that string when referring to resources throughout the lab.

7. On the Review + create blade, ensure the _Validation passed_ message is displayed and then select **Create** to begin the custom deployment.

   > **Note**: The deployment of the custom ARM template should finish in about 15 minutes.

   ![On the Review + create blade for the custom deployment, the Validation passed message is highlighted, and the Create button is highlighted.](media/azure-custom-deployment-review-create.png "Review + create custom deployment")

8. You can monitor the deployment's progress on the **Deployment** blade that opens when you start the ARM template deployment.

    ![The deployment is in progress screen is displayed.](media/custom-deployment-progress.png "Deployment is in progress")

You should follow all the steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
