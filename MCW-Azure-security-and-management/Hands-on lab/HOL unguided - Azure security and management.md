# Azure security and management hands-on lab unguided 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will first deploy a simple web application and database to Azure IaaS VMs, using a Resource Manager Template and Azure Automation DSC. You will then configure a range of infrastructure management capabilities on this deployment, including Update Management, Security Center, Service Map, Change Tracking and Application Insights. You will also use Azure Monitor to configure application alerts, send via both email and mobile application notifications. You will also learn how to further investigate infrastructure status using Log Analytics queries. In doing so, you will learn both how to deploy these solutions and be introduced to their capabilities.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to design, implement and use a wide range of infrastructure management systems in Azure.

NOTE: The setup tasks should be completed in advance of the hands-on lab to save deployment time.

## Overview

Contoso Holdings is a multi-national holding company headquartered in Los Angeles, CA that owns 48 manufacturing companies located in North America, Europe and Asia. These companies sell their products primarily to either distributors or large retail organizations around the world. Contoso, as the parent company, controls the IT systems for the companies that it owns and thus runs their e-commerce based applications. There are about 125 of these e-commerce applications used primarily for business-to-business purchasing by corporate buyers. These apps provide the bulk of Contoso's 15 billion dollars in revenue per year, so they are mission critical.

Recently Contoso has started to investigate what it would take to move from on-premises datacenters to the cloud. Most of their applications are ASP.NET running on Windows VMs with SQL Server in a traditional N-tier configuration. Their goal is to lift and shift these applications over to the cloud while gaining more control over the applications and improving their security posture.

They are looking for you to build out a prototype system in Azure using a sample web application they have provided to you called CloudShop.

They are looking for management tools that will allow them to have a full end-to-end view of both the infrastructure and application performance. Their goal will be to effectively lift and shift all applications over to the cloud. They do not have time or money to instrument the applications. Of course, security is on the top of the chain, so they also need a security solution and updated management system.

Per Roberto Milian, VP of Development and IT Operations - "Contoso's primary concern is how to best: deploy, test, manage, monitor, patch, secure and troubleshoot these applications in Azure IaaS."
