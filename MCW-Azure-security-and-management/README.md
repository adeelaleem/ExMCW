# Azure security and management

Contoso Holdings is a multi-national holding company headquartered in Los Angeles, CA that owns 48 manufacturing companies located in North America, Europe and Asia. In this workshop, you will help Contoso Holdings design and implement the systems to manage their Azure infrastructure at scale.

Per Roberto Milian, VP of Development and IT Operations, "Contoso's primary concern is how to best: deploy, test, manage, monitor, patch, secure and troubleshoot these applications in Azure IaaS."

## Target audience
-	Infrastructure Architect
-	IT Professional
-	DevOps Engineer
- Cloud Solution Architect

## Abstract

### Workshop
With increasing number of resources running in the cloud, enterprise will need to apply the right capabilities to secure and well manage their data and resources. In this workshop, the student will design solutions using Azureâ€™s native security and management services.

### Whiteboard design session
In this whiteboard design session, you will work in a group to examine Contoso's enterprise environment with resources hosted on both on-premises and Azure. In a small working team, students will whiteboard design how Azure Security Center, Key Vault, Update management, as well as Azure Monitor and Application Insights can help secure and well manage applications and virtual machines. Students will also have the opportunity to design governance through Azure Policy.

### Hands-on lab
In this hands-on lab, you will first deploy a simple web application and database to Azure IaaS VMs, using a Resource Manager Template and Azure Automation DSC. You will then configure a range of infrastructure management capabilities on this deployment, including Update Management, Security Center, Service Map, Change Tracking and Application Insights. You will also use Azure Monitor to configure application alerts, send via both email and mobile application notifications. You will also learn how to further investigate infrastructure status using Log Analytics queries. In doing so, you will learn both how to deploy these solutions and be introduced to their capabilities.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to design, implement and use a wide range of infrastructure management systems in Azure.

NOTE: The setup tasks should be completed in advance of the hands-on lab to save deployment time.
