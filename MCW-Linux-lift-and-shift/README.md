# Linux lift and shift

Fabrikam Global Manufacturing & Operations Corporation (FGMO), based in Japan, provides product design, manufacturing, and repair services of domestic individual or industrial electronics, as well as global support for their customers. To avoid any impact from restructured support operations, executives decided to migrate on-premises customer support systems into Microsoft Azure. The hope is that running Linux VMs on Azure should enable FGMO to lower costs while sustaining or even increasing availability of the application.

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this Microsoft Cloud Workshop, you will learn how to migrate a Linux based application to the Azure Cloud. This will include the use of Azure IaaS Virtual Machines and Virtual Machine Scale Sets. Azure platform as a service (PaaS) will also be leveraged including: Azure App Services (Web App), and Azure Database for MySQL. You will also leverage Azure Resource Manager templates, the Linux custom script extension, Github and a Linux Docker Container in the App Service.


### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, attendees will learn how to migrate an existing Linux based deployment into Microsoft Azure and configure it for availability, connectivity, monitoring and general best practices with Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), Virtual Machine Scale Sets and Azure Web Apps with Linux.
-   Configure Linux VMs and VM Scale Sets in Azure for availability, storage, and connectivity
-   Migrate data from on-premises to Microsoft
-   Establish connectivity between multiple regions and on-premises to Azure
-   How to deploy and scale applications to Azure Web Apps on Linux

### Hands-on lab

In this hands-on lab, you will migrate an on-premises based help desk application called OsTicket to Azure. This will be a two-phase project to lift and shift the application into Azure IaaS and then migrate it to Azure PaaS. The application is Linux based using Apache, PHP and MySQL (LAMP). During the process of these phases, you will ensure zero data loss.
