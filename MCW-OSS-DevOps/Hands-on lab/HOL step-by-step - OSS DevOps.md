    ```
    az group create \--name OsTicketPaaSRG \--location \"East US\"
    ```

3.  Execute the following command to create a MySQL Database. **Note**: You must choose a unique name for the MySQL server. Replace **osTicketsrv01** with a more unique value.
    ```
    az mysql server create \--resource-group OsTicketPaaSRG \--name **osticketsrv01** \--location \"East US\" \--admin-user demouser \--admin-password demo\@pass123 \--sku-name GP\_Gen4\_2 \--storage-size 51200 \--ssl-enforcement Disabled
    ```

4.  Add an open firewall rule to the database by executing the following command. Ensure you replace the server name with the unique value from the previous step
    ```
    az mysql server firewall-rule create \--resource-group OsTicketPaaSRG \--server-name **osticketsrv01** \--name Internet \--start-ip-address 0.0.0.0 \--end-ip-address 255.255.255.255

    ![Screenshot of the default App Service deployment.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image60.png "Default app service page")

### Summary

In this exercise, you used several Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) components to configure a Web Application. The Web App will use Azure Storage as well as MySQL for data. You also configured a staging slot for the Web Application with duplicate settings. The actual deployment of the Web Application will happen in an upcoming exercise.

## Exercise 2: Configure local Git repository

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will use the forked GitHub repository from the previous exercise and clone it locally so that you can configure your web app.

### Task 1: Clone a GitHub repository locally

1.  Browse to <https://github.com/>, and login with your GitHub credentials

2.  Navigate to the **osTicket** repository that you forked in the previous exercise

3.  Clone the site locally on your computer for future changes by executing the commands and starting a console/terminal session containing the Git client
    ```
    mkdir repos

    cd repos

    git clone https://github.com/\[**YOUR\_GITHUB**\_**USERNAME**\]/osTicket
    ```

### Summary

In this exercise, you forked a GitHub repository and cloned it locally, so you can configure your web app.

## Exercise 3: Configure Git and Jenkins for continuous integration, delivery and deployment

Duration: 90 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure a Jenkins server in Azure and leverage it along with Git to setup continuous integration & delivery of your Web Application. You will be pulling source code from a GitHub repository and configuring Jenkins to build and deploy the code to your Staging slot before it is pushed to production (manually).

### Task 1: Deploy a Jenkins server in Azure

Jenkins is an open source continuous integration tool written in Java. It provides continuous integration services for software development. It is a server-based system running in a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat. In this exercise, you will deploy a Jenkins Server in Azure leveraging a prebuilt virtual machine image from the Azure marketplace.

1.  If you are leveraging a virtual machine in Azure as your lab machine, first connect to it via RDP Otherwise to deploy a Jenkins Server instance in Azure, browse to <https://portal.azure.com>. Choose **+Create a resource**, type **Jenkins** in the search box, and hit **Enter**.

    ![In the Azure Portal, Create a resource is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image61.png "Azure Portal")

2.  You will notice that there are numerous preconfigured Jenkins servers available in the marketplace, for the purposes of the labs, choose the one submitted by **Microsoft** and select **Create**

    ![In the Everything blade, Jenkins is selected under Results.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image62.png "Everything blade")

### Task 2: Post-deployment configuration of the Jenkins server

Go to the Overview page of the Jenkins VM, copy the DNS name, and open the URL in the browser (for example, [http://osTicketjenkins.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com/](http://osticketjenkins.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com/)). The Jenkins console is inaccessible through unsecured HTTP so instructions are provided on the page to access the Jenkins console securely from your computer using an SSH tunnel. After that, you will update the OS and Jenkins to the latest as well as install other tools needed for our scenario.

1.  Using the FQDN you defined in the previous exercise, browse to your Jenkins portal

    ![The Jenkins on Azure Log In window displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image67.png "Jenkins on Azure Log In window")

2.  Set up the tunnel by opening a PowerShell command prompt on your local computer and copying the ssh command on the browser page from the command line replacing username with the name of the virtual machine admin user chosen earlier.
    ```
    ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8080:localhost:8080 demouser@{yourvmname}.{yourvmregion}.cloudapp.azure.com
    ```

3.  When prompted, enter the password you previously chose. Keep the command line window open.

4.  Get the initial password needed for the next step by running the following command in the command line while still connected through SSH:

    ```
    sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    ```
5.  Copy the password shown to your clipboard, as you will need it to initially login to the Jenkins interface

6.  Open a web browser, and navigate to <http://localhost:8080/> on your local machine. If a **Getting Started** window is presented, choose the **X** in the top of the screen to close it. Then, select the **Start using Jenkins** button.

    ```
    git config user.name \"Your Name\"

    git config user.email \"your\@email.com\"

    git add -A

    git commit -m \"updated model\"

    git push
    ```

**Note**: You may be required to authenticate using your github.com username and password.

5.  Now that a change has been checked in, there are various places to check that the process has worked. Start by checking that the staging website has been updated. **NOTE**: The deployment will take a few moments.

    ![Screenshot showing the updated homepage with the edited content.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image100.png "Support center home page")

    ![The previous fields are set to the previous settings in the Swap blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image105.png "Swap blade")

4.  Once the Swap has completed, verify the changes have been pushed to your production slot by browsing to your production URL

    ![Screenshot of the production url version of the website.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image106.png "Production url")

### Summary

In this exercise, you leveraged Azure, Jenkins and GitHub to setup continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your web site. You built a scenario where your code changes were automatically pushed out to a staging slot after collecting assets from GitHub.

###  

## After the hands-on lab 

Duration: 10 minutes

### Task 1: Delete Resources

1.  Now that the Hands-on lab is complete, go ahead and delete all the Resource Groups that were created for this lab. You will no longer need those resources and it will be beneficial to clean up your Azure Subscription.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
