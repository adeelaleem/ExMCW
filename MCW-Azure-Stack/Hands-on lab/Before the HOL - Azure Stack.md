# Choose your lab

This content consists of two hands-on lab paths, **Azure Stack** and **Azure Stack Operations**. You should only complete the setup for the lab you wish to complete. You may use the table of contents to navigate to the appropriate instructions. The descriptions below are provided to help you decide which lab you would like to complete. 

The first hands-on lab involves starts with deploying the Azure Stack Development Kit, deploying the SQL Database and Azure App Service resource providers, as well as downloading several virtual machine images from the Azure Stack Marketplace. From there, you will implement a full taxonomy in Azure Stack consisting of a region, subscription, plan, offer, and quotas. After Azure Stack is configured, you will then deploy Azure SQL Database, Web and API apps and then deploy the Contoso application.

The second hands-on lab focuses on the Azure Stack operational tasks. In this case, you will also start with deploying the Azure Stack Development Kit, but the subsequent steps will differ. First, you will install the Azure Stack tools. You will subsequently rely on them to create and publish a custom Azure Marketplace item as well as to implement multi-tenant topology by provisioning another Azure Active Directory tenant and adding it to the existing Azure Stack environment. Once that is completed, you will set up delegation by using the delegated provider model and Azure Stack Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). You will conclude this lab by carrying out common Azure Stack maintenance tasks, including log collection (via Privileged Endpoint) and infrastructure backup (by using the Azure Stack Admin portal).

# Azure Stack before the hands-on lab setup guide 

## Requirements

-   A Microsoft Azure subscription.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 8-10 hours

To execute this lab, you will have two options: you can use your own Azure Stack Development Kit that is already installed, or you will need to follow the instructions below to setup your own in Microsoft Azure using nested virtual machines.

For help with installation of the Azure Stack Development Kit, review the following article: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/development-kit>.

### Task 1: Create a virtual machine to execute the lab

1. Navigate to the following URL to launch the AzureStackOnAzureVM deployment template in the Azure Portal.

    ```
    http://aka.ms/AzureStackonAzureVM
    ```

2. Specify the following options on the template settings:

    - Admin Password: **demo@pass123**
    - Public DNS Name: **Specify a unique value**.
    - Auto Install ASDK: **true**
    - Azure AD Tenant: **Your Azure AD tenant**.
    - Azure AD Global Admin: **Your Azure AD Global admin account**.
    - Azure AD Global Admin Password: **Your Azure AD Global admin password**.

    Select **Purchase** when you are ready to deploy the VM.

    > **Note:** This step may take up to 6 hours to deploy. 

3.  After several hours, you may login to the **AzSHost-1** virtual machine using RDP to monitor the installation progress. You will need to use the account:

    -   Username: **azurestack.local\\azurestackadmin**

    -   Password: **demo@pass123**


### Task 2: Download and Run the Azure Stack Configurator Script

In this task you will execute a script that will configure Azure Stack with many of the standard Resource Providers such as SQL, App Service, and MySQL.

1. From within the **AzSHost-1** virtual machine launch an elevated PowerShell console.

2. The script requires the Windows 2016 Evaluation ISO for the Azure Stack Images. Download the ISO with the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Start-BitsTransfer -Source https://cloudworkshop.blob.core.windows.net/azure-stack/iso/win2016eval.iso -Destination D:\WS2016EVALISO.iso
    ```

3. Download the ConfigASDK Script:

    ```PowerShell
    # Create directory on the root drive.
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "C:\AzSPoC"
    Set-Location "C:\AzSPoC"

    # Download the ConfigASDK Script.
    [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
    Invoke-Webrequest http://bit.ly/AzSPoC -UseBasicParsing -OutFile AzSPoC.ps1
    ```

4. Execute the script to configure the Azure SDK (ensure you replace the [placeholder values]). 
 
    > **Note**: This step will take an additional 3 to 4 hours.

    
    ```PowerShell
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "D:\ASDKINSTALL"
    
    .\AzSPoC.ps1 -azureDirectoryTenantName "contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -authenticationType AzureAD `
    -downloadPath "D:\ASDKfiles" -ISOPath "D:\WS2016EVALISO.iso" -asdkHostPwd 'Passw0rd123!' `
    -VMpwd 'Passw0rd123!' -azureAdUsername "admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -azureAdPwd 'Passw0rd123!' `
    -registerAzS -useAzureCredsForRegistration -azureRegSubId "01234567-abcd-8901-234a-bcde5678fghi"
    ```


    > **Note**: If any of the jobs fail, wait for the entire script to complete and run the script again. 


5. Many of the instructions ask you to copy/paste values from the Azure Stack portal. The copy buttons do not work in IE. It is recommended to install Firefox or Chrome inside the VM. 

    ```
    https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
    ```

    ```
    https://www.google.com/chrome
    ```

You should complete these instructions *before* attending the workshop.
