# Hybrid identity hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will set up and configure a number of different hybrid identity scenarios. The scenarios involve an Active Directory single-domain forest named corp.contoso.com, which consists (for simplicity reasons) of a single domain controller named DC1 and a single domain member server named APP1. The intention is to explore Azure AD-related capabilities that allow you to integrate Active Directory with Azure Active Directory, optimize hybrid authentication and authorization, and provide secure access to on-premises resources from the Internet for both organizational users and users who are members of partner organizations.

## Overview

Contoso has asked you to integrate their on-premises Active Directory single-domain forest named corp.contoso.com with Azure AD and implement all necessary prerequisites to allow them to benefit from such Azure AD features as single sign-on to cloud and on-premises applications, enhanced sign-in security with Multi-Factor Authentication and Windows Hello for Business, Hybrid Azure AD join, Self-Service Password Reset and Password Protection, automatic enrollment of Windows 10 devices into Microsoft Intune, and Azure AD Privileged Identity Protection. They also want to provide secure access to their on-premises, Windows Integrated Authentication-based applications from the Internet for both organizational users and users who are members of partner organizations. However, they also want to loosen restrictions when access originates from Hybrid Azure AD joined computers residing in their on-premises data centers. The same applications must also be made available to Contoso's business partners.

## Solution architecture

From the architectural standpoint, the deployment will consist of the following components:

- On-premises Active Directory environment consisting of a single domain controller (DC1) and one domain member server (APP1), running Windows Server 2016 operating system.

- Contoso Azure AD tenant

- Fabrikam Azure AD tenant

    ![High-level architecture consisting of the on-premises environment represented by a rectangle on the left-hand side, two cloud outlines representing the Azure AD tenant of Contoso and Fabrikam on the right-hand side, and the Microsoft Intune icon in the middle. The on-premises environment contains an icon representing Active Directory domain controllers, providing such functionality as Azure AD Connect-based synchronization with attribute level filtering and password writeback, Azure AD Application Proxy with its on-premises connector, Service Connection Point for Hybrid Azure AD join, and Password Protection DC Agent. A webserver icon also represents the hybrid Azure AD joined server hosting the APP1 application, also used as the Password Application Proxy. The Contoso Azure AD tenant provides such functionality as Azure AD application proxy, My Apps portal, Automatic Intune enrollment, Enterprise State Roaming, Conditional Access, Azure AD Identity Protection, Azure AD Privileged Identity Management, Azure AD MFA, and Self-Service Password Reset.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-HybridIdentityImages/media/HOL_Architecture_Overview.png "Architecture Overview")

    ```pwsh
    $domainName = '<custom_domain_name>'
    $users = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity 'Engineering' -Recursive | Where-Object {$_.objectClass -eq 'user'}

    foreach ($user in $users) {
        $user = Get-ADUser -Identity $User.SamAccountName
        $userName = $user.UserPrincipalName.Split('@')[0] 
        $upn = $userName + "@" + $domainName 
        $user | Set-ADUser -UserPrincipalName $upn
    }
    ```
