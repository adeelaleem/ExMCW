## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this workshop, students will learn how to optimize a lift and shift
style IaaS architecture in Azure to improve cost savings. You will also
compare IaaS and PaaS hosting options to save cost even further using
Azure App Service. Additionally, students will learn to improve
resiliency and high availability through multi-region deployment.

Attendees will learn how to:

-   Optimize Azure IaaS for cost savings

-   Migrate an Azure IaaS optimized

-   Compare cost between Azure IaaS versus Azure PaaS

-   Setup SQL Database geo-replication

-   Configure multi-region deployment

## Overview

The Optimized Architecture hands-on lab (HOL) is a hands-on exercise
that will challenge you to calculate Azure spending optimizations by
comparing IaaS and PaaS services using a supplied sample application (a
3-tier application written in C\# and ASP.NET MVC) that is based on
Microsoft Azure IaaS services such as Virtual Machines, Virtual Network,
Load Balancers, Storage and SQL Database. In addition to calculating
estimated Azure cost of the existing architecture, you will need to
calculate the estimated cost of hosting the sample application using
Azure PaaS services. The scenario will include migrating the full sample
application to be hosted on Azure PaaS services such as Azure App
Service Web Apps, Web Jobs, and Traffic Manager as well as implementing
a secondary hosting region for the Web App tier and database
replication.

The HOL can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to
pair up with other members at the HOL to model a real-world experience
much closer and to allow each member to share their expertise for the
overall solutions.

## Exercise 1: Determine Appropriate App Service Tiers and Estimate Cost Savings

Contoso Financial has asked you to optimize their Azure spending by
migrating their existing Azure IaaS based architecture over to Azure
PaaS services. You will need to determine the appropriate hosting tiers
and estimate the total cost savings on a monthly and annual basis.

#### Help references

| App Service Pricing         | <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service> |

#### Scenario

Contoso Financial recently performed a lift-and-shift to move their
application into Microsoft Azure using the North Central US region. As a
result, the existing architecture of the application is implemented with
Virtual Machines, Load Balancers, Availability Sets, SQL Database, and a
Virtual Network.

![The current scenario diagram for Contoso Financial has three users on
the internet passing through an external load balancer to access the
Availability Set (Web App) with two virtual machines. Both the first
availability set, and a second availability set (background processes)
pass through an internal load balancer to a third availability set (Web
API). A SQL Database shares bi-directional access with the Web API
availability set. All three availability sets are subnets of a VNet,
which is in the Azure North Central US
Region.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image18.png "Current scenario diagram")

You have also been provided with the following metrics showing the
average CPU / RAM utilization of the Virtual Machines hosting the
solution that are all on the Standard D3 pricing tier.

When calculating the pricing for the environment, there may be some
differences depending if you use the prices listed in the Azure Portal
or the Azure Pricing Calculator.

![In this Standard D3 pricing tier, the first row is Front-End Web App
Tier, which offers CPU of 36 percent and RAM of 46 percent, or CPU of 38
percent or RAM of 44 percent. The second row is the Back-End Web App
Tier, which has CPU of 58 percent and RAM of 34 percent, or CPU of 56
percent or RAM of 31 percent. The third row is Back-end processing tier,
which is CPU of 49 percent, and RAM of 25 percent. The bottom row,
Database Server SQL Database: Premium P4, has no CPU or RAM
information.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image19.png "Standard D3 pricing tier")

Additionally, the Azure SQL Database is hosted using the Premium P4
pricing tier.

The VM sizes from the Existing architecture that was deployed using the
ARM Template will be slightly different from the diagram above for this
scenario. The reason for this was to make the ARM Template deployment
quicker and cheaper while still deploying enough to allow you to perform
the exercises in this lab.

##### Subtask 5: Identify Appropriate App Service Tier

1.  From a new browser tab or instance, navigate to the **App Service     Pricing** page
    <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service>

2.  Set the **Region** filter to **North Central US**.
    
    ![On the the App Service Pricing page, Region is set to North
    Central US, and Currency is US Dollar
    (\$).](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image39.png "App Service Pricing page ")

3.  Scroll down to the **Standard Service Plan** section.

    ![The Standard Service Plan section displays a table of service plan
    instances, and corresponding number of cores, amount of ram and
    storage, and prices. Instance S1 has 1 core, 1.75 GB RAM, 50 GB

    RAM, 50 GB storage, and costs \$0.20/hour. Instance S3 has 4 cores,
    7 gb RAM, 50 GB storage, and costs
    \$0.40/hour.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image40.png "Standard Service Plan section")

4.  Map the **CPU / RAM** **Utilization** of the **Web App Tier**
    **(1.48 CPU Cores / 6.3 GB RAM)** to the closest **Standard Service
    Plan** tier. These maps to be the **Standard S3** pricing tier.

5.  Map the **CPU / RAM** **Utilization** of the **API Tier** **(2.28
    CPU Cores / 4.55 GB RAM)** to the closest **Standard Service Plan**
    tier. These maps to be the **Standard S3** pricing tier.

6.  Map the **CPU / RAM** **Utilization** of the **Background Tier**
    **(1.96 CPU Cores / 3.5 GB RAM)** to the closest **Standard Service
    Plan** tier. These maps to be the **Standard S3** pricing tier.

    > The **Background Tier** matches almost identical to 100% of the CPU /
    RAM resources of the **Standard S2** pricing tier. However, 100%
    utilization would hinder the performance of the server since the
    resources would be at their maximum. For this reason, it is appropriate
    to go with the **Standard S3** pricing tier instead to leave extra room
    for best performance and possible spikes in load / usage.

7.  Overall, it has been identified that the **Standard S3** is the
    appropriate **App Service Plan** pricing tier to use for the Web
    App, API, and Background tiers.

#### Task 4: Calculate Estimated Hosting Cost of Azure App Service

1.  From a new browser tab or instance, navigate to the **Azure Pricing

3.  If the **SQL Database** is not in the calculator from the previous
    VM estimation, scroll up, add it, and set it to **Premium P4**
    performance level.
    
    ![The SQL Database section displays with the following settings
    Region, East US; Type, Single Database; Tier, Premium; Performance
    Level, P4: 500 DTUs, 500 GB included storage per DB, \$2.5000/hour.
    1 Database multiplied by 732 hours equals \$1,830.00.
    ](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image42.png "SQL Database section")

4.  On **App Service**, change the **Region** to **North Central US**.
    
    ![In the App Service section, Region is set to North Central
    US.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image43.png "App Service section")

5.  Change the **Tier** to **Standard** and the **Instance Size** to
    **S3** to reflect the App Service Plan tier identified as the
    appropriate hosting tier for the Web App, API, and Background
    application tiers.
    
    ![In the App Service Section, Region is North Central US, Tier is
    Standard, and Instance is S3: 4 vCPU(s), 7 GB RAM, 50 GB Storage,
    \$0.400.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image44.png "App Service Section")

6.  Change the **Instances** count to **5** to reflect the same number
    of instances of the existing VM architecture (2x Web App Tier, 2x
    API Tier, 1x Background Tier).
    
    ![At the bottom of the App Service Section, 5 instances multiplied
    by 732 hours equals
    \$1,464.00.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image45.png "App Service section")

    > The **Instance Count** should remain **5** since the application will
    still need the same amount of resources to host; it is just the Azure
    Service hosting them that is changing. For example, since the Web App
    Tier needs 2 VM instances, the App Service Plan will also use 2
    instances for hosting.

7.  Record the **Estimated monthly cost**. This is the total estimated
    cost of the new environment App Service Instances and SQL Database
    only.
    
    ![On the Your Estimate page, the the App Service cost is \$1,464.00,
    the SQL Database cost is \$1,830.00, and the estimated monthly cost
    is \$3,294.00.
    ](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image46.png "Your Estimate page")

#### Task 5: Calculate Estimated Cost Savings

1.  Copy the **Estimated Cost** of the **Existing Architecture** (VMs
    and SQL Database).

    > The original **Existing Architecture** cost that was estimated came to
    approximately **\$6,902**. Your estimate may vary, depending on current
    Azure pricing.

2.  Copy the **Estimated Cost** of the **New Architecture** (App Service
    and SQL Database).

    > The **New Architecture** cost that was estimated came to approximately
    **\$3,582**. Your estimate may vary, depending on current Azure pricing.

3.  **Subtract** the estimated cost of the **New Architecture** from the
    **Existing Architecture** to calculate the **Estimated Monthly Cost
    Savings**.

    -   Existing -- New = Estimated Monthly Cost Savings

    > From the estimates above this would be:
    > \$6,902 - \$3,582 = \$3,320
    > Remember your results may vary, depending on current Azure pricing.

4.  To calculate the **Annual Cost Savings**, take the **Monthly Cost
    Savings** and multiply it by **12**.

    -   Monthly Cost Savings \* 12 = Annual Cost Savings

    > From the estimates above this would be:
    > \$3,320 \* 12 = \$39,840

    > Remember your results may vary, depending on current Azure pricing.

5.  Make note that these **Estimated Cost Savings** do not include
    bandwidth, storage and other charges that will be incurred in
    hosting the application. The estimates calculated above only pertain
    to the **App Service Plans** and **SQL Database**.

    > From the estimates above this would be:
    > - Estimated Monthly Cost Savings: \$3,320
    > - Estimated Annual Cost Savings: \$39,840

## Exercise 6: Setup SQL Database Geo-Replication

Due to the rush into Production, the Staging SQL Database currently
remains as the Production database for the application. You have been
asked to implement Geo-Replication to the SQL Database in order to add
the appropriate redundancy to safeguard against failures. This will both
help eliminate data loss in case of a data center failure as well as
greatly reduce the potential system downtime in the event of such a
failure.

## Exercise 7: Take down old architecture / resources

Since the Contoso Financial application has now been migrated to Azure
PaaS services utilizing Azure App Service, the older, existing
architecture no longer being used needs to be removed. Since the
application has been validated to work as expected, you have been asked
to delete the Azure IaaS components hosting the VM infrastructure.

#### Step 1: Remove Old VM-based tiers

1.  Click on **Resource groups**, and then click on the
    **ContosoExistingRG** resource group.

2.  Delete the following resources that are hosting the OLD Web App,
    API, and Background tiers.

    -   **BackgroundAV**

    -   **WebAPIAV**

    -   **Background1**

    -   **WebAPI1**

    -   **WebAPI2**

    -   **WebApp1**

    -   **WebApp2**

    -   **WebAPILB**

    -   **WebAppLB**

    -   **background1nic**

    -   **webapi1nic**

    -   **webapi2nic**

    -   **webapp1nic**

    -   **webapp2nic**

    -   **Background1-ip**

    -   **WebAPI1-ip**

    -   **WebAPI2-ip**

    -   **WebApp1-ip**

    -   **WebApp2-ip**

    -   **WebAPPLBIP**

    -   **AppVNET**

    -   **Background1-nsg**

    -   **WebAPI1-nsg**

    -   **WebApp1-nsg**
    
        ![In the Azure Portal left menu, Resource groups is selected. In
        the Resource grups blade, ContosoExistingRG is selected. In the
        ContosoExistingRG blade, Overview is selected, and all names
        under the list of resources are
        selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image135.png "Azure Portal")

    > Be sure not to delete the Azure SQL Database (**contosofinancialdb**)
and Azure SQL Server. These are still in use!

3.  Delete the **Storage Accounts** with the following name prefixes:

    -   **diag**

    -   **disk**
       
        ![The two previously listed Storage Accounts
        display.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image136.png "Storage Accounts")

4.  Once all of the resources for the VMs that are no longer needed have
    been deleted / removed from the **ContosoExistingRG** resource
    group, the only resources left in that resource group should be the
    **SQL Databases and Servers**.\

## Exercise 8: Setup European Web App Tier Instance

As Contoso Financial expands into Europe, they need to handle the
additional growth while maintaining the same application performance.
While to fully support global scale, there are pieces of the application
that will need to be refactored, as you have been asked to setup a
secondary region for the Front-end Web App Tier in the Azure North
Europe region.
