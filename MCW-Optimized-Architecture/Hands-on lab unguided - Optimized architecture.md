## Optimized Architecture hands-on lab unguided

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this workshop, students will learn how to optimize a lift and shift
style IaaS architecture in Azure to improve cost savings. Students will
also compare IaaS and PaaS hosting options to save cost even further
using Azure App Service. Additionally, students will learn to improve
resiliency and high availability through multi-region deployment.

Attendees will learn how to:

-   Optimize Azure IaaS for cost savings

-   Migrate an Azure IaaS optimized

-   Compare cost between Azure IaaS versus Azure PaaS

-   Setup SQL Database geo-replication

-   Configure multi-region deployment

## Overview

The Optimized Architecture hands-on lab (HOL) is a hands-on exercise
that will challenge you to calculate Azure spending optimizations by
comparing IaaS and PaaS services using a supplied sample application (a
3-tier application written in C\# and ASP.NET MVC) that is based on
Microsoft Azure IaaS services such as Virtual Machines, Virtual Network,
Load Balancers, Storage and SQL Database. In addition to calculating
estimated Azure cost of the existing architecture, you will need to
calculate the estimated cost of hosting the sample application using
Azure PaaS services. The scenario will include migrating the full sample
application to be hosted on Azure PaaS services such as Azure App
Service Web Apps, Web Jobs, and Traffic Manager as well as implementing
a secondary hosting region for the Web App tier and database
replication.

The HOL can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to
pair up with other members at the HOL to model a real-world experience
much closer and to allow each member to share their expertise for the
overall solutions.

## Solution architecture

Manager](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image2.png "Solution architecture")

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription

2.  Local machine or a virtual machine configured with Visual Studio
    2017 Community Edition or better



## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up an environment to use for the rest of
the exercises.

#### Task 1: Create a virtual machine for your lab environment 

1.  Launch a browser using incognito or in-private mode, and navigate to
    <https://portal.azure.com>. Once prompted, login with your Microsoft
    Azure credentials. If prompted, choose whether your account is an
    organization account or just a Microsoft Account.

2.  Click on **+ Create Resource**, and in the search box, type in Visual Studio
    Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 (x64), and press enter. Click
    the Visual Studio Community 2017 image running on Windows Server
    2016 and with the latest update.

3.  In the returned search results, click the image name.

    > ![In the Everything blade, Visual Studio Community 2017 is typed in

## Exercise 1: Determine Appropriate App Service Tiers and Estimate Cost Savings

Contoso Financial has asked you to optimize their Azure spending by
migrating their existing Azure IaaS based architecture over to Azure
PaaS services. You will need to determine the appropriate hosting tiers
and estimate the total cost savings on a monthly and annual basis.

#### Help references

| App Service Pricing | <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service> |



#### Scenario

Contoso Financial recently performed a lift-and-shift to move their
application into Microsoft Azure using the North Central US region. As a
result, the existing architecture of the application is implemented with
Virtual Machines, Load Balancers, Availability Sets, SQL Database, and a
Virtual Network.

![The current scenario diagram for Contoso Financial has three users on
the internet passing through an external load balancer to access the
Availability Set (Web App) with two virtual machines. Both the first
availability set, and a second availability set (background processes)
pass through an internal load balancer to a third availability set (Web
API). A SQL Database shares bi-directional access with the Web API
availability set. All three availability sets are subnets of a VNet,
which is in the Azure North Central US
Region.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image18.png "Current scenario diagram")

You have also been provided with the following metrics showing the
average CPU / RAM utilization of the Virtual Machines hosting the
solution that are all on the Standard D3 pricing tier.

When calculating the pricing for the environment, there may be some
differences depending if you use the prices listed in the Azure Portal
or the Azure Pricing Calculator.

![In this Standard D3 pricing tier, the first row is Front-End Web App
Tier, which offers CPU of 36 percent and RAM of 46 percent, or CPU of 38
percent or RAM of 44 percent. The second row is the Back-End Web App
Tier, which has CPU of 58 percent and RAM of 34 percent, or CPU of 56
percent or RAM of 31 percent. The third row is Back-end processing tier,
which is CPU of 49 percent, and RAM of 25 percent. The bottom row,
Database Server SQL Database: Preium P4, has no CPU or RAM
information.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image19.png "Standard D3 pricing tier")

Additionally, the Azure SQL Database is hosted using the Premium P4
pricing tier.

The VM sizes from the Existing architecture that was deployed using the
ARM Template will be slightly different from the diagram above for this
scenario. The reason for this was to make the ARM Template deployment
quicker and cheaper while still deploying enough to allow you to perform
the exercises in this lab.

    sample application in the Existing Architecture using Reserved
    Instances.

    architecture.



## Exercise 2: Integrate Traffic Manager

Contoso Financial needs new load balancing solutions implemented using
Azure Traffic Manager. The existing architecture uses a Load Balancer,
but that does not accommodate the growth of Contoso Financial
appropriately where they will need to add additional hosting regions in
Europe.
